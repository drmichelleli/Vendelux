Last week Cologne became the hub for digital trends by hosting #DMEXCO and #DIGITALX and I was part of it.

The focus of the Dmexco was AI and how society can embrace it, also by sharing data (it will become our ""new normal"").

Digital X on the other hand, pointed out 3 trends security, future of work and sustainability. 

My honest feedback: I would definetly try my best to be part of it again in 2025. It`s about the people I met, the conversations I had and definetly the masterclasses I visited. 

The fact that I mixed some meetings with great people (thank you again for taking the time!) and also having some free which lead to meeting super interesting new people (I definetly want to catch up soon) was the best way to enjoy those three days in Cologne.

7242485360394473473,"5 years ago, I joined the media industry as an apprentice.

In this time, my love for advertising has only grown, this is an incredible industry, where some amazing work takes place.

But as well as the good within, I, like many others have come to the realisation that we‚Äôre at a tipping point, our industry can‚Äôt continue along its current path.

Seven in ten advertising campaigns generate a return on investment of less than ¬£2 in revenue for every ¬£1 spent, putting their profitability into question.

Billions of pounds in media spend is wasted every year, there are hundreds of separate reports which validate this.

The vast majority of advertising is disliked by consumers.

Quality publishers are struggling to survive.

The business model is struggling with clients on agency merry-go-rounds and staff underpaid and overworked.

I attended the Who Cares Event put on by Brian Jacobs & Nick Manning last week.

It was inspiring to hear from some of the industry greats on how we can change this industry for the better.

This wasn‚Äôt a session to bash the current state of play, it was on how we can look forward.

The reality is, that the principles of advertising are the same today as they were 100 years ago, a great advert will always be great.

Let‚Äôs face it, advertising is far too often over-complicated and as a result, it regularly gets a bad rep.

But guess what?

It matters.

We all know how important advertising can be not just in driving sales, but also in culture.

It‚Äôs about the emotions it stirs. The way it moves people. The messages it sends.

But we need to be better at telling this story with harder numbers and stronger words.

One that goes beyond reach, clicks, and other vanity metrics.

The business model is changing, and with this, we need to start recognising the true value of great advertising.

It's not about pumping out ads and campaigns.

It's about identifying growth opportunities, designing solutions, and using tech and creativity to make them happen faster.

I‚Äôm sure there will be a lot more to follow from last week‚Äôs session.

But one thing is certain, it‚Äôs crucial that as a collective we have more conversations on how we can improve the advertising and media industry for the better.

And ultimately, caring is the first step to change.",,2024-09-19T10:51:08.755Z,no,2024-09-19,"post date: 2024-09-19 5 years ago, I joined the media industry as an apprentice.

The year is ~2013, my co-founders Nils, Lucas, and me had just closed our first hand-full of clients with our first company, hired our first employee and were ready for our first ""big"" event. Much like everything we did back then, we had exactly zero clue (in this case, how events worked). 

So... 

1Ô∏è‚É£ We picked an absurdly off-target event (the NUFAM Karlsruhe, a trade show for commercial utility vehicles üòÇ - we were SaaS for project management even back then)

3Ô∏è‚É£ We had exactly no pre-campaign at all, so our booth was empty about 80% of the time

The whole situation was so embarrassing (and such a waste of time), that we left after day 1 of a 4 day event, gave the booth to our neighbours (Piaggio Group, they parked a car on it üíÅ‚ôÇÔ∏è) and wrote the whole thing off. Total disaster.

Came across this little gem of a photo while our team around Ayla, Julia, Julian, Philipp & Co. were organising this year's wonderful DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference for us (and stressing out about it) and I was wondering, why I was so feeling so relaxed... well, we've come a long way since that first booth, and I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have grown since then üëè and of that (sometimes very awkward) journey.

The year is ~2013, my co-founders Nils, Lucas, and me had just closed our first hand-full of clients with our first company, hired our first employee and were ready for our first ""big"" event. Much like everything we did back then, we had exactly zero clue (in this case, how events worked).

1. Surprisingly advanced models. I have been at this conference for 10+ years and I feel like the overall community skill level is actually growing (or AnyLogic focusses on the advanced models, both would be good imo)

2. Surprises: even for a seasoned modeler, some presentations tried something quite rare or new. Such as ""AnyLogic inception"": build your model from a running experiment, or ChatGPT integrations

3. AnyLogic trying new formats: Lots of attendees really enjoyed the AnyLogic-9 workshop that was a role-playing exercise highlighting its features. Kudos to Andrei Borshchev for excellent acting. I think we need to combine our passion for it next time üòÉ 

4. Networking: Being an online conference, this was basically left to attendees. But it was a good reminder for me to reach out to colleagues and friends again.

5. I am getting old: It was quite a weird feeling to see several presentations in which I was involved with indirectly. Some seeds I started at a clients years ago sprouting into big initiatives... Felt a bit like a gardener watching trees blossom...  ü§ó 

6. Lack of academia: All presentations were from real-world use-cases. I know academia and research is important, but I do prefer seeing lots of practical applications in my rare free time. (And WinterSim does offer more than enough space for Academia imo)

7. AnyLogic 8: great to see the team keeps on improving it massively, even polishing ""minor"" libraries like the road-traffic lib. Keep pushing

8. Omniverse: Lots of positive feedback during the demo. But more interestingly the discussions that are starting about it now.

Zwei kontroverse Ans√§tze, aber was mich besonders gefreut hat: Ich wurde in meinem Ansatz best√§tigt, dass ""nicht jeder Klostein eine Community und Subkultur braucht"".

Markenpower im Social Media-Zeitalter¬†‚Äì Der Vortrag von Ann-Katrin Schmitz hat mich direkt gepackt. Besonders spannend fand ich den Aspekt aus der neuen Sprout Social Studie ""The 2024 Influencer Marketing Report"", dass die Wahrnehmung von Marken und die Kaufentscheidung zwischen Gen Z und uns Millennials stark differenziert. F√ºr mich ein klarer Reminder, wie wichtig es ist, sich dezidiert mit der eigenen Zielgruppe auseinanderzusetzen.

Panel Talk: Sind Influencer Brands ""over""?¬†‚Äì Danke an Hans Neubert f√ºr die spannenden Einblicke. Auch wenn es keine √úberraschung ist, dass circa 2% der Influencer in den n√§chsten Jahren ihre eigene Brand auf den Markt bringen, war es ein Aha-Moment, der noch einmal verdeutlicht, dass Influencer ihre langj√§hrig aufgebauten Communities zu einem wirkungsvollen Asset machen.

Neben einem Kaffee mit Sarah F√ºtterer und Julija Murawskij, einem kurzen Catch-up mit Hanna Berger und Fach-Deep-Talk mit Sandra Benger, habe ich einige wertvolle Takeaways von der DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference mitgenommen, die mich nicht nur in meiner Arbeit best√§tigen, sondern auch neue Impulse setzen, um einige Strategien nochmal aus einer anderen Perspektive zu betrachten.

I was educated and grew up with the understanding that everyone is equal.¬†
This time is different, as we are not dealing with humans.¬†
On Saturday morning, terrorists¬†from the Hamas penetrated into Israel, to people's houses, and¬†butchered¬†entire families. Babies, kids, women and¬†elderly.
They went to a music festival and slaughtered everyone. I personally know a few people that either murdered or got kidnaped to Gaza. People that only want to dance, listen music and celebrate life got murdered by those animals.¬†

I was educated and grew up with the understanding that everyone is equal.¬†
This time is different, as we are not dealing with humans.¬†
On Saturday morning, terrorists¬†from the Hamas penetrated into Israel, to people's houses, and¬†butchered¬†entire families. Babies, kids, women and¬†elderly.
They went to a music festival and slaughtered everyone. I personally know a few people that either murdered or got kidnaped to Gaza. People that only want to dance, listen music and celebrate life got murdered by those animals.¬†

7250232546943188992,"[Video Recap of SparkTogether 2024] SparkTogether by SparkToro and Amanda Natividad is the best conference I‚Äôve ever been to. Having won best speaker at the remote event last year and being invited to speak again this year, I intended to spit fire like a fully grown dragon and win the title again. 

However, I was quickly humbled when the other speakers ignited the stage.

They didn‚Äôt spit fire, they were fire. One by one like Phoenixes they bared their souls setting the room ablaze with wisdom and incredibly powerful stories.

We SparkedTogether!

Sarah Stockdale who inspired my talk and helped improve it got the only standing ovation. Her talk was nuclear and left the room with a radiant glow of inspiration. The ovation is in the video so watch it.

-SparkTogether is not an SEO conference but I learned some things about SEO
-It‚Äôs not a business conference but I learned a lot about business
-It‚Äôs not a Tony Robbin‚Äôs life coaching event, but I learned a lot about life, finding my purpose and got inspired.

-I learned that lots of agencies & business owners have suffered in the last few years and what they did to survive¬†
-I learned about the power of being vulnerable and asking for help.¬†
-I learned how to go viral and why it‚Äôs important that, that should not be your goal.¬†
-I learned how to publish a book and I got inspired by many of the attendees that I talked to who are incredible human beings.

SparkTogether is an experience.
We laughed, we cried, we learned.
We SparkedTogether.

As a speaker, finding a stage to be authentic and vulnerable is hard. It‚Äôs almost impossible at normal conferences. 

SparkTogether is different because it is built for that.

I shared the stage with the best of the best:

¬†Rand Fishkin, Geraldine DeRuiter, Ann Handley, Sarah Stockdale, Eli Goodman, Britney Muller, Michael King, and Anne-Laure Le Cunff.

When I left it exhausted and depleted because I relived life and death traumas, trying to show people how and why they should use their digital marketing skills for good. Geraldine stole my speaker badge and flashed me a cheeky smiley saying, ‚ÄúLooking for this?!‚Äù It‚Äôs the laugh I needed and made me realize why meeting people in real life at events like this is important. üòÇ 

Geraldine‚Äôs talk was incredible! If you go to any conference next year it has to be this one.¬†Hopefully I‚Äôll see you there and we can SparkTogether.

Thank you Rand, Amanda Natividad, Casey Henry and everyone I meet in person, for an incredible experience. 

Shout out to Kateri Kosta and her friend for sharing this amazing experience with me.

7179490216322174976,"I‚Äôm back from PAX East, a journey across the ocean made possible by the incredible PSVR Without Parole community. 

This year started tough, marked by job loss, living away from home, and putting projects on hold. PAX was the emotional reset I needed, letting my passions for connection, compassion, and technology thrive.

My first gaming event in the States didn't disappoint. The vibrant energy of hundreds of booths, thousands of industry professionals, and tens of thousands of gamers filled the air, all enhanced by the wonderful PAX East volunteers who made me feel welcomed.

The highlight? Finally meeting my co-hosts Bryan, AJ and Wes in person, and hosting a PSVR GAMESCAST LIVE episode together in a hotel lobby, surrounded by our supporters who flew in for the occasion. Their support has been a backbone to my journey, and this offered a profound moment to express my gratitude in person.

Then, a surprise visit from BJ of Urban Wolf Games, jetting in from GDC in San Francisco to spend a few precious hours with us before flying back to South Korea, truly underscored the dedicated spirit of this community. Our enlightening discussions on nurturing the industry and advancing PSVR2, despite hurdles, were inspiring.

PAX East was more than gaming business. From savoring fantastic pizza, exploring retro games, attempting mech pilot training, to meeting awesome devs like Schell Games and Jackbox Games, attending insightful panels, and exchanging greetings with Pikachu, it was a comprehensive experience that revitalized my spirit.

This trip was a much needed reminder of why I do what I do and the impact it has.

Yes, I‚Äôm a fucking fan boy of Hugging Face. These guys are my Backstreet Boys, my Nsync, my Take That. Man ‚Äì I‚Äôm getting old. I‚Äôve been working ‚Äì rather successful I might add ‚Äì in the tech industry for ages. Started to work as a CTO, Founder, CEO, hard core business developer, visionary, tech-enthusiast, graphic designer, marketer, programmer in my past. Passion and a solid understanding of Business, Technology, Design & Marketing accompanied my way. Building up successful companies, merging with others and always believing in the better. Also with a strong believe in the open-source movement, making #Pimcore the first open-source PIM/MDM in 2009 together with my dear founders Christian Fasching and Bernhard Rusch. Now used by over 110k companies on the globe, being a Gartner Customer Choice. What would happen, if we add some of that magic to Pimcore? Did I say ‚Äúsome‚Äù? Fuck no! Let‚Äôs make Pimcore the leading open-source AI/ML driven platform on the globe. With some assistance, knowledge and magic potion, by our friends at Hugging Face. That‚Äôs the plan.

Just a quick side note concerning being a fanboy: Dominik Matyka, Gian-Marco Spinosa, Randolf üíõ Jorberg, we have to get them to the DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference stage. The big one. Sir Martin Sorrell is great. Sure! But these guys give a true and valuable insight into the pure future of our economy and society. I would build up a 5 floor alpine hut (https://lnkd.in/dtPHS2V9) with my own hands to be able to show some open-source love at DMEXCO. I‚Äôd rather not being left back in regards to AI/ML topic in Germany. Even as I‚Äôm Austrian ‚Äì living between the cows in the Alps. So, for example check-out laion ai, to see what‚Äôs going on in Hamburg. They‚Äôve released the leading German-aware LLM based on Llama-2 a few days ago. Guess what? Open-Source, sure!

What‚Äôs in it for Pimcore you may ask. Right! And I‚Äôve a bold answer for that. We wanna lead the pack, integrating AI/ML into the core of our beloved Pimcore. And I‚Äôm not only talking about natural language processing here, but also the wild stuff that is in front of us. Data modelling, ETL, smart assistants and some other craziness, I‚Äôll share, when having a beer or two. Exactly this is on my mind and also on our AI/ML roadmap. And the Hugging Face Expert Acceleration Program will be a valuable source for inspiration and the passion to fulfill my dream. We are working on it and we will keep you guys updated.

Na DMEXCO 2024 o futuro do marketing digital est√° no centro das discuss√µes. 
A jornada Data-Driven do Marketing e a import√¢ncia de dados para campanhas mais personalizadas foram os highlights.

IA generativa na cria√ß√£o de conte√∫dos, direcionando o planejamento de campanhas, otimiza√ß√µes e entrega no target. IA como habilitadora de m√∫ltiplas possibilidades!

A privacidade de dados e as novas regula√ß√µes seguem mudando e direcionando o jogo.

A responsabilidade social no uso das tecnologias e dados permearam ambos os congressos.

A reflex√£o √© que as grandes transforma√ß√µes nos provocam com novas e grandes perguntas.

O agora e o futuro direcionados pela transforma√ß√£o digital cont√≠nua e o sucesso dos resultados vir√° da melhor combina√ß√£o estrat√©gica das tecnologias.üí°

It was huge fun being on stage with Ghassan Karian and sharing Ipsos UK data on the top traits of successful performance based organisations. 

Ipsos Karian and Box survey over 3 million employees per year all over the world and have distilled the most important traits of those who achieve the holy grail of both people and sustainable business performance. It was great to share this insight alongside my own 20 years of shaping organisations for the better. 

Thank you to the whole team in York and London who put the presentation together. 

Big shout out to a wonderful audience - loads of great questions, requests for more, tolerance at my chat GPT L&D jokes and trips down memory lane. 

To the great people I met and saw speak - Julian Stodd Helen Marshall Andy Lancaster Celine Floyd Stephanie Hopper Amy Brann Laura Overton

Thank you to Robin Hoyle for hosting and the whole WOL team.

It was great to share this insight alongside my own 20 years of shaping organisations for the better. 

Thank you to the whole team in York and London who put the presentation together. 

Big shout out to a wonderful audience - loads of great questions, requests for more, tolerance at my chat GPT L&D jokes and trips down memory lane. 

To the great people I met and saw speak - Julian Stodd Helen Marshall Andy Lancaster Celine Floyd Stephanie Hopper Amy Brann Laura Overton

Thank you to Robin Hoyle for hosting and the whole WOL team.

We did a live survey during the conference and we‚Äôll be issuing this shortly - so do look out for that!

""The Future in Germany is Migrant"" was the powerful slogan of the event that was divided into three parts: A panel discussion, engaging workshops, and networking with startups.  

I want to express my gratitude to Ana √Ålvarez - Founder and CEO of Migrapreneur ¬Æ for inviting me to participate in the panel discussion. It was an honor to share my journey and discuss the challenges I've faced as a migrant in Germany. Being part of such a meaningful conversation was a privilege.
I am deeply thankful to Migrapreneur for awarding me two scholarships through Coursera last year, specifically in UX Design and Digital Marketing and E-commerce. These opportunities not only enriched my skill set but also opened up new possibilities in my professional path. Being part of the Migrapreneur community has truly been a game-changer.

During the workshop sessions, I had the opportunity to attend Pedro Duarte's workshop, where he shared valuable insights into creating the podcast ""La Vida de Nosotros"" in Germany. The session was interesting and inspiring, offering a unique perspective on storytelling in a new cultural context.

Lastly, during the networking time, it was a pleasure connecting and exchanging experiences with mentors and experts like Arun M., Julieta Alvarez, and Manuel S√°nchez .

‚úÖ¬† Shifting B2B Buying Behaviors: The way businesses buy has evolved significantly. The avenues for vetting suppliers have multiplied, making it crucial for us to be present where our audience seeks information.

‚úÖ¬† Video as the Game-Changer: The audience consistently turns to video throughout their buying journey. Immersive video experiences make people more receptive to sales engagements.

‚úÖ¬† Video: The Most Impactful Tool: An astonishing 91% of marketers believe that video is our arsenal's most impactful marketing tool.

‚úÖ¬† Perception of Value: Interestingly, people often perceive video as an expensive endeavour. However, the value it brings far outweighs the investment.

‚úÖ¬† MOST IMPORTANTLY: Retention, Attention! The stats speak for themselves‚Äî we remember a mere 20% of what we read but a whopping 80% of what we watch in video content. And here's the kicker: analytics and video go hand in hand to unlock its full potential!

At DMEXCO, it became crystal clear that video isn't just an option; it's necessary for any forward-thinking marketing strategy. It's the medium that can connect us with our audience on a deeper level, driving engagement and conversion.

So, let's embrace the power of video, tell our stories, and create immersive experiences that resonate with our audience. üöÄ

Listened to a great panel who shared how the project was brought to life. I‚Äôm obsessed with industrial parks so this was a highlight. Ran off the bus straight to the ‚ÄòNAIOP Gives Back‚Äô event in partnership with U.S. Hunger. We collectively packaged 15,000 meals for people in need!! 

After that, I attended the conference reception to rep Altus Group‚Äôs property tax division with the team. Then went to various events hosted by BGO, JLL, SAXIUM LIMITED, Kimley-Horn Seyfarth Shaw LLP, Professional Service Industries, Inc. (PSI), and a couple more! The historic Tropicana was imploded at 2:30am during the conference, so of course us CRE lovers had to gather together to see it go. The Tropicana has been a Vegas staple for 67 years but the area will now be developed into a sports hub.

Converge was by far one of the best conferences I‚Äôve attended. And a conference that gives back to the community is huge. Each session had outstanding information and esteemed speakers.

A big thank you to the Shopware crew for another memorable event and also to our partners who joined us as co-exhibitors. Always great to be joined by the Nosto crew of Marcel Krabath and Thomas Hofer. Saw some old faces, met some new faces and realised that it is most probably a good thing that I do not drive bumper cars every weekend.

A big thank you to the ADCELL (Firstlead GmbH) team and Julian Kopp for joining the party with our first ever bubble waffle and photo booth stand. I never thought I would get to ever enjoy 3 of my favourite things together at once in a bubble waffle (blueberries, smarties and nutella), but hey when in Cologne :).

It is really great to see that CDPs (Customer Data Platforms) are getting some more spotlight and their importance for online shops cannot be undermined. I am excited to see where this topic goes in the future too.

Der Austausch im Nachgang sowie die anschlie√üende Diskussionsrunde u.a. mit Dr. J√∂rg Reinnarth, Markus Milz, Michael Bregulla, Dr. Mirjam Ringer, Stephan Kl√∂ckner und Julia Rosenberger haben wirklich Spa√ü gemacht und neue Perspektiven er√∂ffnet! 

Ein gro√ües Dankesch√∂n an die Organisatoren f√ºr diesen gelungenen Auftakt!

Der darauffolgende Tag war gepr√§gt von inspirierenden Momenten auf der Digital X und der DMEXCO.

This suggests that the future belongs to #gaming platforms üéÆ. Anyone who, like me today, dives into gamescom won't be surprised. The global market is worth around 280 billion USD.

But there is still room for improvement. Only a few brands are active in gaming. During COVID the marked expected a boom, but gaming platforms have yet to achieve a breakthrough as a media channel. 

After all, advertising in the gaming environment is not that easy. Many marketers have had problems with Tiktok. But immersing yourself in gaming environments is a completely different challenge. In these parallel worlds, you have different cultural codes, languages, and ways of interactingü§ñ. A brand has to know them if it wants to present itself credibly there.¬† 

This is complex and requires people who know the communities and who can develop creative, customised, immersive brand experiences ‚ô•. Because individual experiences are the current trend. Standardised, programmatically bookable in-game ads may be simpler and cheaper, but they are often boring and with little impact. 

Brand experiences, on the other hand, trigger engagement and create added value without disrupting the gaming experience. This is particularly important in premium games in order to create acceptance. 

Good in-game marketing is currently a small-scale, manual task that makes this channel very expensive for brands. However, the market is still at an early stage. More complex formats will be able to be booked automatically in the future. For example, three-dimensional objects, branded avatars üï∫üèæüíÉüèº or logos that can be customised using a modular principle. 

One thing is certain: the market will develop enormously. Because, as #Gamescom shows, gaming inspires the masses.

A few weeks ago, someone who isn't involved in trade shows asked me, ""Are trade fairs still relevant? With so many digital ways to gather information, why would people still attend trade fairs?""

Spoiler alert: Yes, trade fairs are definitely still relevant‚Äîespecially in the era of new work and digitalization. 

Last week reaffirmed that, ultimately, business is conducted between people. There's a unique dynamic when individuals meet face-to-face, share a coffee or beer, engage in spontaneous brainstorming sessions, and discuss the technical challenges they face in order to forge new partnerships and find solutions.

This headline could appear as early as 2040 in digital industry publications. The figure stems from the McKinsey Global Institute‚Äôs Report, which identifies digital advertising as one of the core technologies set to drive economic growth through 2040.

So, what do these 90 percent mean in absolute terms? In 2022, digital ad revenues reached $520 billion. By 2040, these revenues could soar to $2.9 trillion in the more optimistic scenarios. Besides the ongoing shift from traditional to digital channels, four key factors fuel this evolution:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Global middle class growth
2Ô∏è‚É£ Increased consumer attention on digital media
3Ô∏è‚É£ Positive ROI of digital ads
4Ô∏è‚É£ New digital media formats

But who will benefit the most from this growth? Currently, a few walled gardens dominate the market. In the future, we might see new platforms emerge ‚Äì both global and local ones. The structure of these future channels will shape the data set companies can use to target customers. Additionally, AI is poised to dramatically alter the customer journey. 

This brings up more than just the question of how AI will affect the market and which media channels will emerge. It also raises questions about how AdTech solutions can keep the open web attractive for advertisers, how branding strategies might evolve as available channels focus on performance, and, of course, how pricing will develop within this ecosystem.

#eCommerce generated around $4 trillion in 2022, and by 2040, this could reach $14 to $20 trillion, according to the study. The online share of non-food segments could climb as high as 38 percent.

Growth will come from emerging markets with expanding middle classes. But the researchers also see potential in developed regions like North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific, where new e-commerce categories still offer growth opportunities. Categories that appeal to customers‚Äô emotions show strong potential for #SocialCommerce, which could become a major industry driver.

All in all, McKinsey predicts that e-commerce will achieve the following shares by 2040: 
üåé North America - 50 percent
üåè Asia-Pacific - 40 percent
üåç Europe - 36 percent

The main trend is that we‚Äôre no longer bragging about AI ‚Äî we're using it. All attention now üìå -  how AI can enhance our product and user experience.


1. AI is the New Ad Prodigy: Forget cookie-cutter  strategies. AI is stepping in like a genius intern that knows everyone‚Äôs coffee order *and* how to optimize your ad spend. Expect smarter audience targeting, better campaign results, and fewer creepy ads following you around.

2. Retail Media is Having a Moment: Retail media is the new ‚Äúit‚Äù platform‚Äîtaking first-party data from e-commerce and turning it into ultra-precise ads. It‚Äôs like getting a perfect gift without even dropping a hint. All your favorite shops can now show you an ad and share your data with a ""community"". 

3. Privacy is the New Black: Brands are ditching third-party cookies and going all-in on first-party data. Why? Because consumers want transparency, not surprise tracking. Think of it like dating‚Äîhonesty gets you further.

4. First-Party Data Takes Center Stage: Say goodbye to third-party cookies (eventually) and hello to first-party data‚Äîthe good stuff you collect directly from customers. It‚Äôs like cooking at home instead of ordering takeout. Healthier, tastier, and way more in control.

5. Programmatic Ads & DOOH: Programmatic ad buying is growing up, moving into fancy digital billboards and DOOH (Digital Out-of-Home). Now your ads can appear both on your phone and while you're waiting for the bus. we talked about it for ages, but now I saw it in real-time...

6. Video is Still King, but Add AR/VR to the Mix: People are glued to their phones and love video. Brands are making them even stickier with immersive experiences like AR/VR. Soon, watching a video might feel more like living in one.

7. Cookies Aren‚Äôt Dead, but They‚Äôre on Life Support: Third-party cookies are still hanging on, but the party‚Äôs winding down. First-party data is taking over, with tools like hashed emails helping brands target without being creepy.

These trends show where digital marketing is heading: smarter, more privacy-conscious, and definitely more immersive. Keep up, or be left out in the digital cold!

I was amazed by the presence of numerous retailers at the conference, such as OBI Group Holding, OTTO, and Lidl in Germany. It felt more like a retail event than a marketing and tech-focused conference. Of course, there were also many exhibitors showcasing the #eCommerce industry! üõçÔ∏è

In the startup valley, I noticed several services dedicated to eCommerce, including analytics, ad campaign optimization, A/B testing, creative work, post-view and post-click optimization, conversions, and attributions. This was a significant highlight compared to previous years.

I want to emphasize the industry's growing trend of retail and AI. One of the talks that stood out to me was by Birk Angermann from Shopify. The ""Imagine the AI-Powered Future of Commerce"" was genuinely captivating. It delved into how cutting-edge technology could shape the future of most businesses.

The conference attracted many attendees, giving it a genuinely European vibe. It was great to see business partners and people I know personally there. While I had the opportunity to attend some fantastic speakers and live meetings on the first day, the second day was dedicated to networking and connecting with my business partners ü§ù

The only downside was that some talks were conducted in German without English translation, making it challenging to understand the content. However, overall, it was an amazing conference, and I'm already looking forward to attending next year! üéâ

7165727922278920192,"My Journey with the Digital Umma IT Forum 2024 üåô üë©üíª 

Alhamdullilah, This past February 17th, I had the privilege of being part of a brilliant event in Almaty, Kazakhstan - the Digital Umma IT Forum, hosted at Nur-Mubarak University. It was a pioneering gathering for Muslim tech enthusiasts, attracting over 1600 applications and 1000+ participants. This forum wasn‚Äôt just an event; it was a celebration of innovation, where 30+ expert speakers from leading Islamic startups and top tech companies shared their insights and visions for the future.

The feedback from both speakers and attendees was overwhelmingly positive, with many commending the event's high level of organization and the quality of interactions it facilitated.

In my role as a designer and marketing strategist, I contributed across multiple dimensions: visual identity that included the branding and logo, developing the UI/UX for the event website (digital-umma.com), designing presentations for sponsors and the event's physical decoration. Most importantly I led our marketing on Instagram, with a video invitation that went viral (+43K views), boosting our community to over 3000 followers and ensuring our content, including reels, that consistently received thousands of views. Check our page: 

https://lnkd.in/gAvHjq6d

I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this remarkable event and am excited to carry forward the insights and experiences gained as I continue to explore the intersection of design, technology, and social impact.

Alhamdullilah, This past February 17th, I had the privilege of being part of a brilliant event in Almaty, Kazakhstan - the Digital Umma IT Forum, hosted at Nur-Mubarak University. It was a pioneering gathering for Muslim tech enthusiasts, attracting over 1600 applications and 1000+ participants. This forum wasn‚Äôt just an event; it was a celebration of innovation, where 30+ expert speakers from leading Islamic startups and top tech companies shared their insights and visions for the future.

The feedback from both speakers and attendees was overwhelmingly positive, with many commending the event's high level of organization and the quality of interactions it facilitated.

In my role as a designer and marketing strategist, I contributed across multiple dimensions: visual identity that included the branding and logo, developing the UI/UX for the event website (digital-umma.com), designing presentations for sponsors and the event's physical decoration. Most importantly I led our marketing on Instagram, with a video invitation that went viral (+43K views), boosting our community to over 3000 followers and ensuring our content, including reels, that consistently received thousands of views. Check our page:

I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this remarkable event and am excited to carry forward the insights and experiences gained as I continue to explore the intersection of design, technology, and social impact.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making the Digital Umma IT Forum a success. I hope and pray to be part of more such events that bring the innovation and social good to both umma and world.

Historical industry statistics don't lie: between 2000 and 2014 alone, clothing production doubled, and consumers began buying 60 percent more clothes and wearing them for half as long as before. In the world today, more than 100 billion pieces of clothing are produced per year for a global population of 8 billion people.

Is there a solution to this reality? 

Appeal to a change in habits, but also the use of new inputs and fabrics of forest origin that consume a third of the energy and 60 times less water when compared to a synthetic fiber or cotton.

This was one of the topics addressed at the Milan conference ‚ÄúChallenge the Fabric 2024‚Äù, which focused on sustainability, traceability and innovation in materials in the fashion industry and challenged designers to create sustainable looks to promote a shift towards bio-based and recycled materials.

We had the opportunity to share Arauco‚Äôs sustainability practices in this challenging times and some trends that we see are going to happen in the future. New regulations, Ecosystem Services at Landscapes, and Nature Positiveness where some of them.

It‚Äôs always a pleasure when an exhibition goes beyond just business and transforms into an exchange of ideas, knowledge, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs be honest‚Äîquite a few laughs! 

Meeting my amazing new team the first time in person, catching up with our fantastic customers, and forming new partnerships was definitely a highlight. üíºü§ù

This year, Gen AI and its role in Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) stole the show. But here‚Äôs the kicker: while it may sound like a simple topic, anyone in the field knows that real, long-term success doesn‚Äôt come from shortcuts. It comes from testing, refining, and testing again. There‚Äôs no magic formula ‚Äì just hard work, data, and a commitment to improving the user experience, because at the end of the day, that‚Äôs what keeps customers coming back. üîÑ

At the heart of CRO is making your customers feel valued, making it easy for them to engage, and ensuring their experience is smooth as butter. And guess what? That never goes out of style! üßà‚ú®

	1.	Brands have never been more important. Gen Z and Gen Y are heavily influenced by brands when making decisions.
	2.	Happy and excited CEOs do exist! Great brand stories and approaches shared by the CEO Philip Hitschler-Becker of a candies brand Hitschies. Non-usual approach how to build brand via the content and basically being a part of the content. 
	3.	From the 10 principles of Kapton&Son and Charles Chairman Artjem Weissbeck  I was reminded how rewarding it is to tap into the new areas and to scale new on its early stages. Check out their value creation solutions via WhatsApp
	4.	Henkel  showcased how to generate 1M impressions for the employer brand by turning employees into company influencers! And I think it is great to showcase a company‚Äôs vibe. As a Henkel employee, I‚Äôm adding my own voice with this post , even though it would be better to post from Monday to Thursday on this platform ))). And this journey is guided by C√©line Flores Willers - great speaker with strong insights and a great representative of women in business. 
	5.	As a former Nestl√© employee, it was exciting to hear Perrier Global Business Director Elisa Gregory talk about Perrier‚Äôs rejuvenation‚Äîbeing strong at the core while allowing the brand‚Äôs identity to stretch. I loved hearing about the launch of Maison Perrier. Big brand, big responsibility, big budgets‚Äîscaling right from the start. My two favorite Nestl√© brands?

üìä Germany is the second biggest market in Western Europe behind the UK, but will experience significant growth over the next few years. Next year (according to EMARKETER) will see a 24% YoY growth - https://lnkd.in/e-eGZ3Ux 

For those that were on the fence about going and didn't, I whole heartedly recommend next year - A case of less is more when compared to my last visit pre pandemic (or maybe I am getting old)

‚úÖ  Less halls - easier to navigate
‚úÖ  Less exhibitors - less cluttered, more space easier to see who is exhibiting
‚úÖ Less people - no more free tickets meant a more focused crowd

Finally, as always with these events it's brilliant to catch up with partners, explore new opportunities and bump into old colleagues and friends.

Five years ago, if you‚Äôd told me I‚Äôd return to DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference as an HR ambassador, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed you. Back in my e-commerce days, DMEXCO was all about products and marketing campaigns. 

This year, however, I took the stage with a new focus: how employee experience directly shapes customer experience and ultimately defines brand value. üí°

The challenge? Too often, we talk about ‚Äúemployer brand‚Äù and ‚Äúemployer branding campaigns‚Äù without addressing the deeper need for strategic alignment between Marketing and HR. 

The truth is, an employee‚Äôs experience directly influences the customer‚Äôs experience and, therefore, the strength of the brand.

In my session, ‚ÄúHuman Experience at Work: Backwards to a Brand that Moves Us,‚Äù I shared how we at HRS Group are working on aligning our ways of working with the promises we make to customers. 

By applying our Leading Principles, we are fostering a work environment where employees live and breathe the competencies needed to enhance the customer experience and therefore the brand value step by step. üîÑ

The hack: This alignment not only elevates the customer experience but also attracts professionals who resonate with our mission, fostering innovation and meaningful work.

Being back at DMEXCO was incredible - same energy, but from a new perspective. Thanks to everyone who joined the discussions!

Someone at my son's school stated the kids will hopefully be the generation that figures out how to clone (or at least beam) somebody, as she could really use it. Thinking of next week, I feel the same.

That's how I solve it: I plan everything around my fixed speaking slots (of course) and the goals and values I have set for myself - translating into the people and content I want to listen to and interact with as well as including some selfcare time. 

Here are some of my fixed slots:

17th of September, attending German Federal Association of the Digital Economy (BVDW e.V.) OAS Summit in the morning till early afternoon - shout out to my SDA Lab Lead Partner Lisa Vieweg, Steffen Hubert or Nadja Schick who will be on stage. Really looking forward to your sessions.

Same day, I will make a quick switch from OAS to #VideoWeek 's #VideoWeekCologne to join a panel around the question How the Next-Gen Premium Media Ecosystem could look like hosted by Vincent Flood

18th is focussed on conversations and content.

19th I will host the session ""Responsible Media: Warum Verantwortung √ºbernehmen auch eine Business Entscheidung ist."" at BVDW Masterclass (MC7A) 13:45 - 14:15 Thanks to Beatriz Bilfinger for your brilliant organisation.

I‚Äôve been thinking about how to honor Hispanic Heritage Month in a way that is enough. Authentic enough, informed enough, and meaningful enough to matter. And I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôve had writer‚Äôs block on this topic, which has led me here to this final day of this lovely month of respect and appreciation for the rich cultures of the Hispanic diaspora.
¬†
But last week on a long flight, I read a book. A real hard copy book, and this book called ""Life and Death of the American Worker: The Immigrants Taking on America's Largest Meatpacking Company"", helped to unblock me with the power of storytelling, the necessity of empathy and care, and the proximity to my home state and even my hometown. This is not an ad, and I am not an affiliate. But my one caveat before I go on, is that the author is my first cousin, and I am naturally a bit biased.
¬†
This book documents the life of both legal and illegal immigrants and refugees coming to the United States to make a better life, who end up working at Tyson, one of the mainstay companies fueling the Arkansas economy. Most of these immigrants are Hispanic, many do not speak English well, some are illiterate, all are vulnerable. And this book is hard to read ‚Äì not because the prose is difficult or overly fancy (it's not), but because the topic is tough. This book feels personal. There are mentions of my tiny hometown and the Tyson plant there - a place I've driven by a million times. There are mentions of a college friend‚Äôs father who went to prison in the 90s while working at Tyson, a memory that I had completely lost but that came flooding back with great precision. There is discussion of the NGOs who help settle refugees and immigrants in Arkansas and then funnel them into the chicken pipeline that runs like a constant loop of backbreaking work, untreated injuries, gaslighting, and more.
¬†
This book is hard to read.
¬†
But it‚Äôs also beautiful, bringing forth the dreams people have to make a better life, to take care of their families even at great cost to themselves, to raise children who have more opportunities than their parents had, and to build community with shared values and goals.
¬†
My experience with Hispanic Heritage has been long and rich. From living in Peru as a child and traveling around South America with my weaving parents; to my dad‚Äôs experience living in Mexico for over 20+ years; to earning my MBA from an international program and meeting so many remarkable Spanish speaking humans; to one of the best managers I ever had who was a cigar smoking Mexican man and a thoughtful, smart, and kind leader. All of this - these people and experiences - have enriched my life, taught me meaningful lessons, and shown me what it means to create joy from even the smallest spark of possibility.

This book is hard to read. But it‚Äôs also important to read. I hope you‚Äôll honor it and the Hispanic people whose lives it chronicles with the gift of your time and mindshare.

I‚Äôve been thinking about how to honor Hispanic Heritage Month in a way that is enough. Authentic enough, informed enough, and meaningful enough to matter. And I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôve had writer‚Äôs block on this topic, which has led me here to this final day of this lovely month of respect and appreciation for the rich cultures of the Hispanic diaspora.
¬†
But last week on a long flight, I read a book. A real hard copy book, and this book called ""Life and Death of the American Worker: The Immigrants Taking on America's Largest Meatpacking Company"", helped to unblock me with the power of storytelling, the necessity of empathy and care, and the proximity to my home state and even my hometown. This is not an ad, and I am not an affiliate. But my one caveat before I go on, is that the author is my first cousin, and I am naturally a bit biased.

Thank you Ryan D. Taylor and Taj Ahmad Eldridge for hosting the Diverse Climate Tech Eco-System event. I left feeling inspired and motivated by the sweet community of people I met there! Environments that reflect the world affirm that representation matters and it is up to us to create the spaces we want to see in the world. üß°  It also sounds like Energy is a hot investment these days~

Carbon Newbie Summit hosted by Michelle Li was a blast! I learned that professionals who have experience working in the climate space still feel like newbies since the industry is rapidly changing with new research, innovation, and policies. You can view speaker details, stream the event recording, and calculate your carbon footprint at carbonnewbie.com, but here are just a few of the many interesting highlights:

>The average American emits ~15 tons of CO2 per capita a year...the global average is 6.3 tons. 

>Emails: Send links to folders vs. attach files because a normal email is .3g CO2e and attachments are upwards 50g CO2e.

>Private Jets are 5 -14x more polluting per passenger than commercial flights.

>PPM = parts per million (#/1million air particles)
*Pre-industrial levels we were at 280ppm of CO2
*As of March, we are at 427.0 ppm of CO2
*Scientists say we should not surpass 450ppm of CO2
We have work to do!

>Allbirds is changing the footwear and apparel space by labeling every product with the amount of carbon it took to produce. Michelle said, ""We see calories for our food but we really don't see [carbon label measurements]"". It reminded me of a brainstorming conversation I had with my Climatebase fellow Mar√≠a Fernanda L.! Wouldn't it be awesome if we could access that information when we shop? I believe it would motivate greener decisions for brands and consumers. Jeanne Hartshorn is working on it with other fellows, I'm excited to see how it goes!

","What a week it‚Äôs been so far ‚Äì and it‚Äôs only Tuesday!

I had the chance to stop by the Seamless Europe event in Munich for the past two days. For a first edition, it was good, but I would have chosen a different venue. The Messe M√ºnchen venue made the event feel a bit scattered in my opinion.

The presentations and panels I attended were insightful, featuring top-notch speakers from the global trade scene. However, the exhibition itself was heavily focused on fintech and startups ‚Äì I was hoping to see more representation of Commerce, CX, or DXP.

With RetailX happening simultaneously, perhaps it‚Äôs worth reconsidering the dates next year to avoid overlap.

All in all, for a free event, it‚Äôs definitely worth the time. While it‚Äôs still an extension of the Seamless MENA series from Dubai and Riyadh, the Munich edition hasn‚Äôt reached that same level yet. 

Now, on to Berlin ‚Äì next stop: Spryker Excite!

I had the chance to stop by the Seamless Europe event in Munich for the past two days. For a first edition, it was good, but I would have chosen a different venue. The Messe M√ºnchen venue made the event feel a bit scattered in my opinion.

The presentations and panels I attended were insightful, featuring top-notch speakers from the global trade scene. However, the exhibition itself was heavily focused on fintech and startups ‚Äì I was hoping to see more representation of Commerce, CX, or DXP.

With RetailX happening simultaneously, perhaps it‚Äôs worth reconsidering the dates next year to avoid overlap.

All in all, for a free event, it‚Äôs definitely worth the time. While it‚Äôs still an extension of the Seamless MENA series from Dubai and Riyadh, the Munich edition hasn‚Äôt reached that same level yet. 

Now, on to Berlin ‚Äì next stop: Spryker Excite!

‚ú® Imagine an event that seamlessly brings together the Marketing and Tech industries. Well, DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference is even more than that! Every September, Cologne-Germany transforms into a vibrant hub of innovation, discovery, networking, and of course, fun times together.

üé§ Last week, I had the privilege of joining another DMEXCO, returning as a speaker. I joined the IAB Europe - Attitudes for programmatic panel alongside industry colleagues like üí´ Cadi Jones, üí´ Carol Starr, üí´ Schwab Ingo, and üí´ Wayne Tassie. We delved into compelling conversations around why programmatic investments keep growing year on year, the key drivers of programmatic, and reflecting on third-party cookies alternatives.

üöÄ DMEXCO is the ultimate destination for inspiration. I immersed myself in sessions on the New Era of Search, Generative AI, Retail Media, Gaming, Programmatic, and more. Two days of intense learning from the best in the field, making it the premier event to get inspired and educated on the latest trends.

ü§ù But it‚Äôs not just about the sessions. It‚Äôs about the people ‚Äì connecting with clients, partners, agencies, publishers and making new industry contacts. For me, it was also about meeting my amazing colleagues from Microsoft Advertising in person at the Microsoft booth. We sparked conversations in Cologne that will continue to flourish in the coming weeks.

üìÖ If you haven‚Äôt experienced DMEXCO yet and you‚Äôre eager to connect your brand and yourself in the Martech industry, get inspired on how to boost your business, and find the right partners to make it happen, start planning your participation for 2025!

METAVERSE FASHION COUNCIL ha publicado un estudio muy interesante argumentando por qu√© los #videojuegos y la #web3 son la publicidad del futuro - y no tan futuro- y por qu√© como marca deber√≠as plantearte el uso de estos medios poco convencionales.¬†
El estudio destaca la creciente importancia de involucrar a las marcas en el universo del #advergaming y los #videojuegos basados en la #web3. Como profesional, para mi estas son algunas de las razones clave por las que las marcas deber√≠an considerar seriamente esta forma de publicidad y fidelizaci√≥n:
Engagement Inigualable:¬†Los videojuegos ofrecen un nivel de participaci√≥n sin precedentes. La interactividad y la inmersi√≥n proporcionadas por el advergaming generan experiencias memorables que perduran en la mente del jugador.
Conexi√≥n Emocional:¬†Los videojuegos tienen el poder de crear conexiones emocionales duraderas. Al incorporar la marca en la trama del juego, se establece una relaci√≥n m√°s profunda y aut√©ntica con el usuario.
P√∫blico Diverso y Global:¬†La comunidad de jugadores abarca todas las edades y demograf√≠as, lo que significa que las marcas pueden llegar a audiencias diversas y globales a trav√©s del advergaming.
Inmersi√≥n en la #Web3:¬†La web3 introduce nuevas posibilidades, como la propiedad de activos digitales y la tokenizaci√≥n. Al participar en juegos basados en web3, las marcas pueden explorar modelos de negocio innovadores y experiencias √∫nicas para los usuarios.
Fidelizaci√≥n del Cliente:¬†El #advergaming en la web3 no solo atrae a nuevos clientes, sino que tambi√©n fortalece la lealtad de los existentes. Los jugadores disfrutan interactuar con marcas que comparten sus intereses, creando as√≠ una comunidad comprometida.
Las marcas que abrazan la evoluci√≥n hacia el advergaming y los videojuegos en la web3 est√°n posicion√°ndose para el √©xito en el futuro del marketing digital. La combinaci√≥n de tecnolog√≠a innovadora, engagement excepcional y conexiones emocionales s√≥lidas ofrece oportunidades sin l√≠mites. Claro ejemplo de ello es que firmas de la talla de McDonald's, adidas o Kellanova han confiado en empresas especializadas en advergaming como Playoffnations para lanzar estrategias disruptivas dentro de entornos virtuales conocidas como Roblox o Rocket League
Sin duda, es el momento de sumergirse en el universo del advergaming y web3 gaming y dar un giro emocionante a las estrategias de marca.¬†

DMEXCO 2023 was a special highlight for me. As an intern in B2B Online Marketing at Douglas Marketing Solutions, I had the opportunity to organize our booth with Linn R√∂denbeck and Jessica Koch.

This marked the first time Douglas Marketing Solutions had its own booth at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference. It was an exciting project that I wouldn't want to miss. üòä 

Over the past months, we invested a lot of time into brainstorming ideas, making plans, and finally bringing our booth to life.
It was a rollercoaster ride with challenges that occasionally pushed me to my limits. But that's what made it so thrilling! We stuck together, found solutions, and in the end, created a booth we can be proud of.

DMEXCO 2023 was the most significant project during my internship at Douglas Marketing Solutions. It provided me with valuable experiences in B2B Online Marketing and helped me grow personally.

I want to express my sincere gratitude to my team and everyone who visited us at DMEXCO. You made this event truly special!

7173828451315953664,"SXSW 2024 Musings

I attended SXSW for the 12th time this past Thurs-Mon and wanted to share some candid thoughts and opinions from the perspective of someone who has attended every year since 2011 (w/ the exception of 2 pandemic years).

- This was the most sprawling the conference has ever felt, with the usual Convention Center / Rainey St center of gravity expanding well into rapidly gentrifying East Austin, south towards the still new-ish Soho House, and in all directions to the many private and VIP events that no longer feel like they are in direct competition with badge programming. This reminds me of the mid-2010s transformation at Cannes, when the commercial activity surrounding the conference started to rival the conference itself. Same vibes at SX this year.

- Delta Air Lines ‚Äúwon‚Äù SXSW this year, hands down. Brand engagement started with the flight into Austin (complete w/ a welcoming committee at the terminal upon touchdown), they solved a legit pain point (providing a fast pass to access official badges), and their Lounge destination was the talk of the town. Shout out to Alicia Tillman for the vision and Team Epiphany for the execution. Pound for pound one of the best SXSW experiences of the past decade.

- Yahoo's brand comeback story continues, and their alignment with universally loved and immaculate vibe-purveyor Poolsuite sent such a strong signal to those in the know that they are serious about getting back on track. Tressie Lieberman and Marty Bell deserve props for throwing the best retro nostalgia-themed party on a competitive Sunday night.

- Conversations with fellow SX veterans revolved around how light the conference felt this year. Attendance numbers for Interactive have yet to be reported, but it felt like there were far fewer badge holders (a lot less chaos in the convention center), less junior and mid-level brand and agency attendees, and less foot traffic in general.

- Large scale brand activations that also did fan service to the general public also felt light, with Audible, LaCroix Water and Porsche AG providing some of the notable inclusive brand experiences for both industry nerds and locals to enjoy. The absence of music platform activations and the disappearance of music publication showcases made Interactive and Music feel siloed in a way that I've never felt before.

- That being said and given the seniority of operators in attendance, it did feel like a very strong year for counter programming, private activations, and VIP events. Some of the highlights that come to mind are Robb Report's House of Robb (incredible execution), Snap Inc. Sanctuary, The Female Quotient‚Äôs Equality Lounge, Brand Innovators, and a Tech For Good dinner by Greg Kahn with Ad Council, Northwell Health, and inKind to discuss how emerging tech can address pressing societal issues such as the gun violence epidemic.

The lazy, hazy days of summer are officially over. As the school bells ring and children return to their classrooms, the business world is also gearing up for a new season. Just as students swap flip-flops for trainers and backpacks, I‚Äôve swapped my beach towel for a laptop and forecasting meetings!

September marks the end of the ""dog days of summer,"" but as the leaves begin to change colour and the temperature drops, for me there is a renewed sense of energy and purpose filling the air. 

Much like for those returning to school, the start of September brings with it a feeling of anticipation and excitement.

The lazy, hazy days of summer are officially over. As the school bells ring and children return to their classrooms, the business world is also gearing up for a new season. Just as students swap flip-flops for trainers and backpacks, I‚Äôve swapped my beach towel for a laptop and forecasting meetings!

September marks the end of the ""dog days of summer,"" but as the leaves begin to change colour and the temperature drops, for me there is a renewed sense of energy and purpose filling the air. 

Much like for those returning to school, the start of September brings with it a feeling of anticipation and excitement. September is a pivotal month in my business year.¬† We see a huge increase in events, trade shows, new marketing campaigns, the pressures to end the quarter strongly and for many the start to the frantic run up to¬†the Q4 peak.¬†

Nachdem wir in diesem Jahr schon zum zweiten Mal auf der #OMR vertreten waren, sind wir vom 18. bis 19. September 2024 zum ersten Mal mit einem eigenen Stand auf der #DMEXCO in K√∂ln am Start.

Ich muss zugeben, dass die DMEXCO in den letzten Jahren in meiner Wahrnehmung h√§ufig hinter dem Tamtam der OMR zur√ºck geblieben ist. Dabei passt die DMEXCO eigentlich viel besser zu inboundfriends und unseren Kunden.

Das hat vor allem drei Gr√ºnde:

üíØ B2B statt B2C: Bei inboundfriends sind wir zu 100% auf B2B-Unternehmen spezialisiert. Damit passen wir super auf die DMEXCO, die einen st√§rkeren B2B-Fokus hat als die B2C-orientierte OMR.

üõ†Ô∏è¬†Tool-Expertise: Als Experten f√ºr CRM- und Marketing-Tools finden wir auf der DMEXCO wahrscheinlich mehr interessante Kontakte und potenzielle Kunden als auf der OMR. Viele namhafte Tool-Anbieter, wie @HubSpot, sind auf der DMEXCO sogar mit einem eigenen Stand vertreten.

üéâ¬†Weniger Party, mehr Substanz: Wir konzentrieren uns als Agentur auf erkl√§rungsbed√ºrftige Produkte und Services. Ich hoffe, dass die DMEXCO mehr Raum f√ºr tiefgehende Gespr√§che zu komplexen L√∂sungen bietet als die OMR mit ihrem Party-Spektakel. Auch wenn ich meine Erinnerungen an unsere legend√§re Standparty nicht missen m√∂chte üòâ 

Seid ihr eher Team DMEXCO oder Team OMR? Wer von euch ist am 18. und 19. September in K√∂ln dabei?

Why do we invest so much time and money into the DMEXCO?

At first, I thought the answer was obvious. But it got me thinking.

Why do we prioritize this one event over multiple smaller ones?

Although we do attend other significant industry events, DMEXCO remains our top investment.

Why?

Because as one of the leading AdTech companies for programmatic advertising in Europe, DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference is where our primary audience converges.

Nowhere else do I see such a concentration of our clients and industry peers, all eager to discuss the latest trends and opportunities in digital marketing and technology.

Microsoft est√° llevando su tecnolog√≠a publicitaria al siguiente nivel con las √∫ltimas actualizaciones de¬†Copilot AI, un avance significativo en la personalizaci√≥n de anuncios y la creaci√≥n de experiencias publicitarias interactivas. Estas nuevas funciones permiten a las marcas no solo optimizar sus campa√±as, sino tambi√©n crear contenido m√°s relevante y ajustado a las preferencias individuales de cada usuario.

Gracias a la integraci√≥n de inteligencia artificial m√°s avanzada, los anunciantes ahora tienen la capacidad de generar experiencias que capturan la atenci√≥n y generan mejores resultados en todas las plataformas digitales. Copilot AI facilita el dise√±o de anuncios m√°s inteligentes y efectivos, al tiempo que ofrece una mayor flexibilidad en la ejecuci√≥n de estrategias publicitarias.

Principales beneficios:
Personalizaci√≥n a gran escala: Las marcas pueden ajustar sus anuncios en tiempo real seg√∫n las interacciones del usuario, maximizando la relevancia.
Optimizaci√≥n continua: La IA aprende y adapta los anuncios autom√°ticamente, mejorando el rendimiento sin intervenci√≥n manual.
Interactividad mejorada: Los usuarios pueden participar en experiencias m√°s din√°micas, lo que incrementa el engagement y las conversiones.
Con estas mejoras, Microsoft reafirma su compromiso con la transformaci√≥n digital de la publicidad, ofreciendo herramientas potentes que facilitan la conexi√≥n con las audiencias y permiten a los anunciantes destacar en un mercado cada vez m√°s competitivo.

¬øSu marca est√° preparada para aprovechar al m√°ximo la inteligencia artificial en la publicidad?¬†El futuro de la publicidad digital ya est√° aqu√≠, y Copilot AI es una pieza clave de esta evoluci√≥n.

It was a special event one that was excellently managed from conception to completion by our very own Mahoko Yoshimoto.

Chinese platforms transform shopping into an adventure. Instead of bland product lists, they use discovery feeds inspired by TikTok and Instagram, where products are part of the content experience. Remember flipping through an IKEA catalog? Today‚Äôs digital version uses visually engaging, scrollable designs with video content and live shopping, making online shopping a time-killer that could seriously compete with Netflix.

Typical product pages often look functional but uninspiring. Chinese sites take a different approach with interactive features, videos, 360-degree views, and integrated user reviews. This makes the experience immersive and boosts engagement, increasing the likelihood of purchase.

In China, shopping blends seamlessly between online and offline. For younger consumers, the ""real"" world includes both digital and physical experiences. Chinese platforms let users explore products online, try them in-store, or experience them through augmented reality. Western retailers could benefit by enabling customers to test products virtually or even immerse themselves in digital worlds. Platforms like Roblox could become the next big shopping destination.

In China, e-commerce is a social event, with chat functions and group video calls allowing friends to shop together. Integrating similar social features could foster real-time engagement on Western platforms. Customers could share reviews, discuss trends, and exchange recommendations, creating a community-driven experience that builds customer loyalty and keeps users engaged longer.

üõçÔ∏è ùêçùêûùê∞ ùêäùêèùêàùê¨: ùêëùêûùê•ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêßùê¨ùê°ùê¢ùê©ùê¨ ùê®ùêØùêûùê´ ùêìùê´ùêöùêüùêüùê¢ùêú
While the West focuses heavily on performance metrics, China emphasizes quality customer relationships. KPIs like browsing time and engagement encourage a richer shopping experience, leading to stronger bonds with customers. Instead of paying per click, retailers can establish lasting customer relationships that are often more sustainable and cost-effective.

I am convinced that the retailers who come up with completely new shopping concepts first have a great chance of capturing significant market shares.

The Expo was declared open by the MD/CEO of NDDC, Dr. Samuel Ogbuku. Dr. Maurice Dawson Jr., Ph.D. the Director, Center for Cybersecurity and Forensic Education (C2SAFE) of the Illinois Institute of Technology delivered the Keynote. 

Yours truly had the honour of delivering the keynote for the Cybersecurity session. My keynote was titled: Emerging Threats and Countermeasures: Building Resilience in Nigeria‚Äôs Rapidly Evolving Threat Landscape. 

The 3-day event had sessions in Cybersecurity, AgriTech, MedTech, EdTech, Energy Tech, AI, among others. The event also featured a Hackathon and Pitch event.

Sulla scia della prima parte del nostro sondaggio sul linguaggio #inclusivo e dato l‚Äôinteresse suscitato da quest‚Äôultimo, rieccoci qua con un secondo post su questa tematica tanto attuale quanto controversa.

Questa volta facciamo affidamento sulle vostre capacit√† analitiche e intuitive e vi spingiamo ad andare oltre il mero messaggio verbale, ovvero lo slogan estrapolato dal contesto visivo. Le opzioni che vi proponiamo giocano sull‚Äôequilibrio sottile di un doppio livello comunicativo: quello linguistico da un lato e quello paralinguistico dall‚Äôaltro. Rappresentano le due facce della stessa medaglia alle quali tutti i #brand si affidano da sempre per rendere un messaggio commerciale accattivante, convincente e al contempo ricco di contenuti non verbali, in grado di far leva sulle emozioni pi√π profonde de…ú consumator…ú. Nel panorama della lingua ‚Äúampia‚Äù, tali elementi rivestono un ruolo cruciale nell‚Äôaffinare la sensibilit√† del pubblico su tematiche sempre meno discriminatorie nei confronti di determinate categorie di persone.

Questa volta abbiamo trovato interessante portare alla vostra attenzione quattro campagne pubblicitarie di larghissima diffusione in Italia, tutte in qualche modo entrate nel patrimonio nazionalpopolare fatto di immagini, certezze radicate e luoghi comuni, che, data la loro familiarit√†, tendiamo a ùêßùê®ùêß mettere in discussione. O almeno non nel modo in cui dovremmo. Le quattro campagne si collocano in un arco di tempo che va dal 1974 al 2016, e rientrano dunque nel ‚Äúrepertorio iconografico culturale‚Äù di tutt…ú …ú utent…ú nat…ú a cavallo tra gli anni Settanta e la Generazione X.
Tra queste, soltanto una trasmette un messaggio davvero ampio e non discriminante su tutta la linea, tanto dal punto di vista linguistico quanto da quello visivo. Le altre tre risultano, per un motivo o per un altro, non inclusive o persino fortemente discriminanti.

Buona visione e buona lettura, siamo cert…ú che saprete fornirci anche stavolta dei validi spunti di riflessione e dell‚Äôottimo materiale per continuare pi√π consapevol…ú il nostro viaggio.

Der Creativity Summit auf der DMEXCO

Seit unserem Brainstorming Ende 2023 war Anke und Matthias begeistert von der Idee eines Summits, der sich ausschlie√ülich der Kreativit√§t in der Digitalbranche widmet. DMEXCO hat sich stets entlang der gesamten Wertsch√∂pfungskette der Digital-Marketing-Industrie entwickelt, aber echte, durchdringende Kreativit√§t war oft nur ein Nebenschauplatz. Heute, auch angesichts der durch KI ausgel√∂sten Dynamiken, wird die Bedeutung von authentischer, einzigartiger Kreativit√§t in Kampagnen und Markenaktivit√§ten immer klarer. Sie muss sich wie ein roter Faden durchziehen, sonst wird sie in der Flut der Inhalte untergehen.

Es ist gro√üartig zu sehen, wie dieser erste Schritt zusammen mit Branchenf√ºhrern gelungen ist. Wir sind gespannt, wohin uns diese Reise bis 2025 f√ºhren wird!

Last week I shared the first 5 of Greg Topalian‚Äôs 10 year/10 predictions for our industry. 

Greg shared these during his session at The Exhibitions and Conventions Executive Forum in DC.

Here‚Äôs the final 5:

6Ô∏è‚É£ 40/60% of trade show revenues will come from attendees.
- There are/will be new ways to charge and increase revenues if you focus on the attendees and the experiences they want and will pay for. 
- Balance revenues out and stop the overreliance on sponsorships.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Attendees want meetings but are telling us ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to meet the people you want me to meet with. I want to choose, not you‚Äù. 
- Ask attendees who they want to meet.
- Then make sure they meet.

8Ô∏è‚É£ It‚Äôs far too easy to keep charging exhibitors a bit more than to try and solve the BIG problems (like unlocking the meetings issue). 
- Squeezing revenues from exhibitors has gotten old and limiting so stop focusing on that.
- Sort out your big issues which would fix revenues for the long term.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Your industry isn't that special. Lots of event execs say, ‚ÄúMy industry wouldn‚Äôt like that,‚Äù but even accountants have human interests, like sports, music, etc. 
- Remember your industry is made up of real people, not job titles. 
- No matter what someone does for a job - don‚Äôt stereotype the kind of experience they might like because of their (supposedly boring) job title. 

üîü Organisers will ask themselves, ‚ÄúCan I really create the experience I want in a traditional exhibition venue?‚Äù The answer may well be ‚Äúno.‚Äù 
- We‚Äôll see more events running in unusual venues, which allow them to deliver richer experiences.

Anything to add?

Modex brought together a melting pot of supply chain professionals, technologists, and innovators from across the globe, offering a rare glimpse into the diverse solutions and products shaping our industry. Here are some personal key takeaways that really stood out to me:

**Global Solutions to Local Problems: Many of the challenges we face locally have already been addressed by the West, offering relatable case studies and insights that are directly applicable to our work.

**Beyond Innovation: The adoption of cutting-edge warehouse automation technologies like ASRS, AMRs, and AGVs isn't just about an innovative mindset. Factors like labor and storage costs, along with labor shortages, are pushing the industry towards these solutions at an accelerated pace.

**Software Reigns Supreme: The backbone of successful hardware turnkey projects is highly flexible, reliable, and scalable software technology. It's clear that in the realm of supply chain solutions, software still wears the crown.

 **Top-tier Talks: The quality of the presentations at Modex was unparalleled. It was a privilege to hear from professionals who have not only devised but also implemented groundbreaking solutions, offering clear and insightful articulations of their work.

 **AI‚Äôs Untapped Potential: The exploration of AI in supply chain management is still in its infancy, presenting a vast field of opportunity for innovation and application.

**A Call to Action for SMEs: The current landscape of supply chain technology often overlooks SMEs due to cost barriers, highlighting a significant opportunity for India to develop cost-effective solutions tailored to their needs.

Attending Modex 2024 was an insightful journey that has broadened my perspective and fueled my excitement for the future of supply chain innovation. The convergence of diverse ideas and solutions at this event was truly inspiring, underscoring the dynamic nature of our industry. Can't wait to see how we can apply these learnings to make a tangible impact!

7251944519032565760,"I had an amazing time speaking at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference last month on my favorite subject: data privacy. Specifically, I explained why this industry evolution is much more important than just cookies - it‚Äôs about data privacy.

It‚Äôs about moving to an ecosystem that removes the needless requirement to share, centralize, and commingle vast amounts of customer data. It‚Äôs about finally moving on from an industry built on slow and unsafe data practices to one built on secure data collaboration and collective responsibility. 

However, to get there, we must address the growing issue of privacy washing. Terms like ""privacy-first,"" ""privacy-safe,"" and ""privacy-centric"" are being thrown around far too easily, often with little substance behind the claims, causing confusion.

Privacy is not something that can be solved by slapping a label on a solution. It should be built in from the ground up. Data collaboration platforms, as I explain in this clip, should be privacy by default, anything less and it is not truly private nor secure. 

When done right, data collaboration should empower you to maximize both privacy and performance. Check out the full video where I explain strategies for avoiding privacy washing and how InfoSum is proving privacy and performance go hand-in-hand: https://hubs.la/Q02TgnBy0

7242401473328783360,"How Europe is becoming the biggest crypto market globally in 2025?

Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak on this question at #DMEXCO #2024 in Cologne. The simple answer: through regulation - but not only. My key points:

- MiCAR creates a single European market for crypto assets with 448 million citizens and a GDP of 16.97 trillion euros. This is the biggest single regulated market for crypto globally
- The short-term potential of retail crypto offerings is particularly significant. 13% of Germans aged 18-64 are already invested in crypto. In comparison, only 20% are invested in shares and ETFs.¬†
- The long-term potential is even bigger - it's about the tokennization of all types of digital ownership and financial instruments. KPMG forecasts the market for tokenised financial instruments in Europe at 330 billion euros in 2030

If you want to learn more about MiCAR and its potential, read our whitepaper and take the KPMG MiCAR Pulse Check. A simple tool that quickly tells you how your business model is regulated and what requirements apply (link in the comments).

Other speakers discussed the potential of programmable money, web3 and token-based economies. Thank you w3.group, Vicktoria Klich, Jonathan Kuhl, Marvin Hug and Philipp Kielholz for the excellent organisation.

Having all VTEXers in one place, all of us were not only able to look back at the amazing journey of 2023 but also lay the groundwork for an even more exciting 2024. The energy and enthusiasm in the room were truly infectious!

What made this experience truly special was witnessing our local Sales and marketing teams collaborating closely with our Core areas. The power of having these talented individuals working hand in hand was nothing short of awe-inspiring. 

We've always known that the synergy within our team is our superpower, and this event reinforced that notion. It's where creative marketing minds met the innovative core of our business, where ideas flowed, and strategies were born. The outcome? An enhanced plan to take VTEX EMEA-APAC to new heights in the year ahead!

Thank you to every VTEX team member for your dedication and passion. You are the driving force behind our success. Here's to an epic 2024 that we'll conquer together!

¬†
This event showcased the power of the connections and relationships that keep our industry vibrant. We thrive on the partnerships we create and the connections we nurture. The event kicked off perfectly with the Dutch industry drinks hosted by VIA Nederland the evening before, setting the stage for a fantastic DMEXCO experience.
¬†
Some key takeaways if you‚Äôre considering attending next year and want to make the most of it:

1. Preparation is key, so start weeks in advance ‚è∞
Set your own goals and start scheduling meetings according to these goals
¬†
2. Join your international stand or partner with your German colleagues, as we did at Adform. Thank you for the great organisation, Adform marketing ‚ù§Ô∏è

First, send people that can take trains or short flights, and where a flight is necessary, make the most of it. As an example, Brenda Tuohig bundled a vacation into her trip to save a flight, and also spent a day in London on her way.

Second, make sure every aspect of the experience is seen through a sustainable lens:
‚Ä¢ Plants are provided by a local supplier who rent and reuse plants for many tradeshows and events¬†
‚Ä¢ Branded Dopper water bottles for guests - an ocean-saving bottle meeting the toughest environmental and ethical standards, made in a factory that runs on 100% renewable energy making its carbon footprint zero
‚Ä¢ A water dispenser inside the meeting house to fill/refill the water bottles for meetings and on-the-go
‚Ä¢ Snacks and energy pick-me-ups in eco-friendly packaging (avoiding plastic)
‚Ä¢ For the Executive Dinner - our guests will be escorted by branded bike taxis from the venue to the restaurant, Neobiota, a michelin star restaurant with sustainable gastronomy as a top priority. This includes short supply chains with local ingredients, avoiding wastage and partnering with sustainable producers. ‚Ä¢ Guest name cards have also been printed on seed paper which can be taken home and planted to grow wildflowers.

Third, remind your CEO that all of these choices save money too. International flights are expensive! Fancy booths that you throw away every year are expensive!

I will be speaking at the Agencies Stage. 
On Thursday, September 19, 2024 10:10 AM to 11:00 AM ¬∑ 50 min. (Europe/Berlin)

To talk about : The Most Valuable Unused Resource in AI Transformation

But not only me, I will be there with :
Alissa Rabe¬†, Moderation, Google
Dora Osinde¬†Osinde, Chief Creative Officer, Ogilvy GmbH
Robert¬†Andersen, MD Creators, Jung von Matt
Matthias¬†Maurer, Gr√ºnder und GF, la red
Jack¬†Smyth, Chief Solutions Officer for AI, Planning and Insights (API), Jellyfish

What will be talking about: While AI models are becoming increasingly powerful, use cases are evolving slowly, and value gains remain modest. The gap between CAPEX and expected returns has now reached the trillions.

The most critical resource for driving applicable AI transformation in companies remains untapped. And no, it's not customer data or GPU seconds.

The topics:
#DigitalTransformation
#DigitalCreativity
#Agencies

Great to be back to Germany and inspired by all the incredible professionals and marketers on stage!
I could share my vision on communication and advertising in an era of uncertainty: creativity and differentiation are paramount. A brand can be omnipr√©sent on Instagram and on Tik Tok but without a deeper meaning behind, that visibility will not bring any company very far. 
When all supermarkets seem a sea of sameness, it is time to cast aside from conformity and reintroduce originality. 
Thank you Maike Abel  for the opportunity to share these deep convinctions on stage, presenting the case of the reinvention of such an iconic brand like Perrier.

¬†
Esta semana IAB Spain ha publicado su informe sobre¬†creadores de contenido y su nueva realidad: El valor del engagement; elaborado junto a Go Talent a trav√©s de Primetag. En √©l se reflexiona sobre la importancia del #engagement frente al n√∫mero de seguidores, algo que me lleva rondando la cabeza en los √∫ltimos meses cada vez que tengo delante una campa√±a de #influencermarketing. ¬øDebemos valorar m√°s la cantidad o la calidad? ¬øDe qu√© me sirve un n√∫mero muy alto de #seguidores si mi contenido no consigue llegar a la mitad de ellos? Desde nuestra posici√≥n como agencia y consultor√≠a creo que es realmente interesante que transmitamos este valor a las marcas que deseen emprender acciones en redes.
¬†
Los creadores seleccionados ten√≠an m√°s de 100,000 seguidores en Instagram o m√°s de 300,000 en TikTok, con un engagement rate medio de al menos 2%, y una audiencia espa√±ola de al menos 30%. Tras analizar su comportamiento en las redes, el estudio recoge que la interacci√≥n es la m√©trica clave, y el contenido creativo debe ser personal y bien ejecutado t√©cnicamente. El engagement debe construirse a largo plazo e ir m√°s all√° del mundo online. La libertad creativa es esencial para el √©xito de las colaboraciones entre marcas y creadores.
¬†
La conclusi√≥n est√° clara: las redes son un mundo en constante cambio y debemos adaptarnos a ello. Hace no tantos meses tener un volumen alto de seguidores era fundamental para que una campa√±a funcionase, ahora debemos poner el foco en la calidad de estos followers antes de lanzarnos a la piscina.¬†
¬†
Dejo por aqu√≠ el estudio que, desde mi humilde opini√≥n, aporta mucho valor.

7244090524020654082,"**Is Retail Media Reaching a Tipping Point?** 

My Takeaways from DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference m

Retail Media Networks (RMNs) has been a hot topic in our industry for a while, but after attending #Dmexco2024, the landscape is shifting. With over 200 RMNs competing for finite marketing pounds, agency executives are urging brands to take a more strategic, calculated approach to their RMN investments.

At Dmexco, I had many conversations about the growing pressure on brands to increase media spend commitments, with retailers eyeing national brand marketing budgets to evolve into full-service ad platforms. However, more spending doesn‚Äôt always mean better results. We‚Äôre seeing a point of diminishing returns, with rising CPMs, inconsistent performance across networks, and too much focus on bottom-of-the-funnel performance.

For smaller RMNs, competing against giants like #WalmartConnect,¬†#AmazonAds, and¬†#Target's Roundel will require either consolidation or lower pricing models. As marketers, we must consider all the options‚Äîwhether¬†investing in RMNs or exploring ad tech alternatives like Xandr and Evidnt. At Bicycle, we‚Äôre focused on helping clients prioritise where their pounds go based on distribution, product availability, and sales goals.

The big question remains: With the cost of retail media rising and performance measures still lacking standardisation, is the juice worth the squeeze? As I learned at #Dmexco, brands must now take a more data-driven, strategic approach to ensure their investments move the needle.

What do you think about the future of #RetailMedia? Are we headed toward consolidation, or will we see innovation that justifies the rising costs? Let‚Äôs discuss it!

7244232812730425344,"I was recently invited to moderate a panel discussion at the DigiMarCon Southeast Asia conference in Singapore on Digital Marketing Trends: Experts Insights on How to Gain a Competitive Edge.

It was a pleasure to share the stage with industry experts like Tim Soulo, Irene Oh, and Silvia Mogas Web3 Marketing PR, who shared invaluable insights and practical approaches to how marketers can stay ahead of the curve in such a fast-evolving landscape.

Fun fact: Tim was a speaker at the very first marketing conference I attended at the beginning of my career, a full-circle moment! 

It‚Äôs amazing to see how much the industry has changed since then with new technologies and platforms that are now a staple to our marketing strategies. It's also personally exciting to now be on the other side of the table, facilitating conversations about the future of marketing.

Here are 3 quick takeaways from our discussion:
üí° Focus on agility, data-driven decisions, and stay in tune with emerging trends
üí° Understand your customers and know your USPs
üí° AI is here to stay and we need to leverage its potential while balancing personalisation

7242550266791706627,"DMEXCO complete! Another year of excellent opportunity to reconnect with friends and colleagues, and this year was special for me for a couple of reasons:


üîπ First (party data) things first: Companies are rightly focusing on building robust first-party data strategies to protect their customers, develop better insights, and maximize marketing performance despite some ambiguity on 3PC deprecation. Our rockstar Googlers Ren√© Zimmermann Christiane Adler Heidi Menz and Sarah O'Hara did an amazing job sharing updates on exactly these topics!


üîπRetail Media continues to mature: Closing the loop between awareness and performance presents a huge opportunity, with ongoing efforts to develop measurement standards and best practices among brands, retailers, and platform partners. The recent study from EHI on Retail Media underscores this common opinion. Thanks to Corinna Hohenleitner Dennie-Alexander Trost Marie-Clare Puffett Christian Leihner and Nikolaus Roettger for the great panel discussion!


üîπAI is becoming operational: While in the early stages, there is broad agreement that AI can drive efficiencies across various business challenges for retailers, from creative production to customer care. Many are still learning and determining where to prioritize their efforts, but it is exciting to see how clients like Douglas and Lufthansa are making it work. Jana van den Bos Riz Syed and Yves Dupont showed how AI is coming to life at Douglas!

I would also like to give a huge shout to our product team who was there to help clients understand our newly announced ‚ÄúConfidential Computing‚Äù capability which offers a valuable layer of additional security when leveraging 1st party data to drive performance across Google Ads solutions. Quaseer M. Chanda Patel John Tobler Thank you so much for coming over to be here in person to meet our customers and partners!

Also thanks to everyone else I met for taking the time and making such a tremendous effort (or just happening to meet up in the hallways :-) and make this another successful DMEXCO!

7242158622997196800,"I have a few thoughts about all the #DMEXCO updates Google announced (some good, some not so good). 

First, be sure to read the great recap from Ginny Marvin here: https://lnkd.in/ev93Fn2R

The Objectively Good:
üòÑ More PMax data is always a good thing and I'm really excited about target pacing and asset insights! Also the campaign level negatives (without the need for a form)! We are getting impression share metrics (fist spotted by Odi Caspi) but I have mixed feelings about those. 

üòÑ Pinning for demand gen videos is a godsend! No longer are we rolling the dice on Google understanding the best placement/length for our content. 

üòÑ AI visual enhancement for all campaign types is a huge boon ahead of Q4! I'm extremely excited to see how the seed images and text descriptions help improve the AI for PMax and Search campaigns alike.  

The Optimist's Excitement:
üòç I'm very interested in the asset recommendations and I'm wondering if this is a sign that the LLMs are getting more intelligent around how different creative resonates with different personas.

üòç I'm fully team brand guidelines and while I know others are cynical about them, I truly believe they will help.

üòç Multi-lingual asset generation can be really good or really bad. I'm leaning into hope here. 

The Cynic's Reservations:
ü§î PMax getting impression share is more concerning to me than anything else. Impression share can only be for search and shopping, and getting that data does two potentially harmful things. It reenforces search bias when the point of PMax is to remove the bias from budget allocation. It also sets us up to hear about a problem that can only be solved by more budget. One of the reasons I love using impression share is to find structural areas to improve campaigns - that's not really possible with PMax...you just add more budget or limit what you're going after. 

ü§î I'm not crazy about 360 getting more tools. More often than not, 360 is more trouble than it's worth, and while enterprise brands can have valid uses for it, there are a lot of folks who struggle to recover from the migration. I'd have liked to see tools for the little guys as opposed to more 360 enhancements.

ü§î Google outright said PMax wouldn't get impression share last year. Now it's rolling out for search and shopping. I can't help but wonder if this is one of the foundational steps to make search/shopping exclusively available through PMax (which isn't inherently a bad thing but not everyone is prepared for that campaign type). This feels especially true since Google's search text advertising business would be a monopoly (if the US could define it as a market), while search advertising was not a monopoly.

7161485706069053440,"Through my last 14 years in the Promotional market I have been attending what should now be hundreds of Trade Shows and Road Shows, most of the times as exhibitor.
During this period I have collected a reasonably good amount of experience on the fine art of promoting a commercial offer and I faced enough episodes to write a book. Unfortunately I‚Äôm not patient enough to go through such a daunting task and I will restrict myself to write a few lines here.
Life as an exhibitor has as ultimate goal leaving a lasting impression on what you are promoting on the victims (AKA the visitors) that during a show must face dozens (if not hundreds) of booths that several times are presenting overlapping products. So during these events many times the exhibitor must become the exhibitionist and selling the dream of the perfect offer composed of products no one else have (though job) with the lowest prices in the market (borderline mission impossible) and all wrapped up in a perfect level of service with the guarantee of zero incidents (and here we are touching the realm of Paradise). 
If all of this was not schizophrenic enough, then a multiplicity of potential episodes just turns the most resilient mind into a poor soul seeking desperately for the end of the event. Let me name just a few I‚Äôve faced during these years:
- There is a farmers‚Äô strike and all the roads are blocked. Convert your expectation of hundreds of visitors to a fraction of it (this also works with heavy rain or snow). 
- A client arrives to the booth with a box full of badly printed pens and demanding a compensation on the spot (in front of all the other visitors). Prepare yourself to be as conciliatory as Gandhi.
- The transport company failed and you have zero samples to show on the exposition. Incredible levels of creativity are requested, including renting 4 giant screens to project your website.
- You find yourself in the middle of a presentation to a visitor with doubtful potential when you see a top 10 client leaving the booth without talking with anyone. Compress your speech in 5 sentences and don‚Äôt let the big fish abandon your boat!
- The catalogues run out by the middle of the second day. Stop blaming the marketing department and offer samples with the business card tagged on them.
- One of the guys of your team extended the ‚Äúclient networking‚Äù in the previous night a bit too long and is looking like a zombie. Pass him two aspirins, a double expresso and a Red Bull.
Despite all the pain and suffering, Trade Shows are unique moments, where people, that many times spent the entire year exchanging mails and phone calls, have finally the opportunity to meet face to face. In that sense Trade Shows are the antipodes of the ever accelerating Digitalization in our Market and it‚Äôs interesting to see that they have not lost their importance (in fact nowadays we have bigger number of structured events than we had 10 years ago).

In that sense Trade Shows are the antipodes of the ever accelerating Digitalization in our Market and it‚Äôs interesting to see that they have not lost their importance (in fact nowadays we have bigger number of structured events than we had 10 years ago).
Looking forward to see you on a Fair around the corner!",post date through my last years in the promotional market i have been attending what should now be hundreds of trade shows and road shows most of the times as exhibitor during this period i have collected a reasonably good amount of experience on the fine art of promoting a commercial offer and i faced enough episodes to write a book unfortunately im not patient enough to go through such a daunting task and i will restrict myself to write a few lines here life as an exhibitor has as ultimate goal leaving a lasting impression on what you are promoting on the victims aka the visitors that during a show must face dozens if not hundreds of booths that several times are presenting overlapping products so during these events many times the exhibitor must become the exhibitionist and selling the dream of the perfect offer composed of products no one else have though job with the lowest prices in the market borderline mission impossible and all wrapped up in a perfect level of service with the guarantee of zero incidents and here we are touching the realm of paradise if all of this was not schizophrenic enough then a multiplicity of potential episodes just turns the most resilient mind into a poor soul seeking desperately for the end of the event let me name just a few ive faced during these years there is a farmers strike and all the roads are blocked convert your expectation of hundreds of visitors to a fraction of it this also works with heavy rain or snow a client arrives to the booth with a box full of badly printed pens and demanding a compensation on the spot in front of all the other visitors prepare yourself to be as conciliatory as gandhi the transport company failed and you have zero samples to show on the exposition incredible levels of creativity are requested including renting giant screens to project your website you find yourself in the middle of a presentation to a visitor with doubtful potential when you see a top client leaving the booth without talking with anyone compress your speech in sentences and dont let the big fish abandon your boat the catalogues run out by the middle of the second day stop blaming the marketing department and offer samples with the business card tagged on them one of the guys of your team extended the client networking in the previous night a bit too long and is looking like a zombie pass him two aspirins a double expresso and a red bull despite all the pain and suffering trade shows are unique moments where people that many times spent the entire year exchanging mails and phone calls have finally the opportunity to meet face to face in that sense trade shows are the antipodes of the ever accelerating digitalization in our market and its interesting to see that they have not lost their importance in fact nowadays we have bigger number of structured events than we had years ago looking forward to see you on a fair around the corner,no,2024-09-18,7.433333333333334

That was already a highlight... but the truuuue standout moment came in the evening: the #CMOoftheYear award gala. Key takeaways?

Biiiig shoutout to Daniel Grieder, CEO & CMO of BOSS, who took home the prestigious CMO of the Year award üèÜ, recognizing the remarkable #transformation and turnaround of BOSS, with 2023 being its strongest year yet. The biggest risk? Taking no risk. (Kafka would agree. üòâ) CONGRATS!! And soooo well deserved!

Event planners LOVE content.

Whenever I've been presenting about how events are content machines, the nodding in the room goes wild.

'Julius, nodding? Is that it?'

Of course not.

Boldpush research says that 75% of event professionals repurpose content.

To add more, the second largest category of eventtech by spend is content management. Boldpush research also says.

I shared it before: a one-hour session = 121 insights.

This incredible content production can be:

- The social media content for months.
- The video marketing that converts attendees.
- The upsell to a content hub
- The email collection tactic to beef up your database.

It will also provide the data to inform you about the content you'll bring to the show floor at the next event.

If you have an AV team on site, I'll be personally angry with you if you don't capture that content.

You can make this happen.

Are you capturing content this year?

""This feels more like a President Club trip than a Kickoff. I'm so fired up.""

""This is best work trip of my life. I love the culture and identity we are building.""

""That was a stellar GKO. The best one yet.""

""I've never been so inspired to work at a company. That was truly incredible.""

""This was a great opportunity to bring together the entire GTM organization globally and learn how our customers are leveraging the Glean platform to transform their business.""

""We have an amazingly talented team that gives each other grace for support and collective grit to push and grow across GTM, ENG, R+D.""

""A huge thank you to my Glean team, whose perfect blend of heart, execution, and customer obsession makes achievements like this possible. Here's to many more milestones together!""

‚ûû Real Human Connection

‚ûû Co-creating Marketing¬†
The power of making your customers experience your brand is unrivaled. When they can interact with it live, it‚Äôs a different game.

‚ûû Peers and Community
Meeting other customers, peers, and community members is an unrivaled level of engagement. 

‚ûû Content That Travels Far
Every event is a huge content creation opportunity that can play into all stages of the funnel.

O #retailmedia est√° a dissolver uma barreira antiga: a separa√ß√£o entre o marketing de marca e o marketing de desempenho. 
Num painel da DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference 2024, Daniel Knapp, do IAB Europe, destacou que o canal emergente tem o potencial de alinhar dois mundos que at√© ent√£o t√™m sido vistos como opostos.
De facto, com a crescente utiliza√ß√£o de dados, intelig√™ncia artificial e segmenta√ß√£o, os profissionais de marketing est√£o a transformar suas estrat√©gias. Os resultados falam por si: cada vez mais or√ßamentos est√£o a migrar da televis√£o tradicional para o retail media; mas a grande quest√£o que paira sobre as marcas √©: ser√° que o retail media tamb√©m consegue impulsionar a constru√ß√£o de marca a longo prazo?

H√° definitivamente muitos desafios, especialmente em termos de medi√ß√£o e provas independentes do impacto na marca. Acresce que a falta de uma padroniza√ß√£o entre as diferentes redes de retail media tamb√©m dificulta a optimiza√ß√£o dos gastos.

Estamos, parece, num ponto de viragem -- e se o retail media conseguir ultrapassar essas barreiras e provar o seu valor para o marketing de branding, podemos estar prestes a testemunhar a verdadeira converg√™ncia entre branding e performance.

H√° definitivamente muitos desafios, especialmente em termos de medi√ß√£o e provas independentes do impacto na marca. Acresce que a falta de uma padroniza√ß√£o entre as diferentes redes de retail media tamb√©m dificulta a optimiza√ß√£o dos gastos.

Estamos, parece, num ponto de viragem -- e se o retail media conseguir ultrapassar essas barreiras e provar o seu valor para o marketing de branding, podemos estar prestes a testemunhar a verdadeira converg√™ncia entre branding e performance.

2. AI: Beyond the Buzzword ü§ñ:

3. Navigating the Retail Media Maze üß≠:¬†

Embrace Existing Standards:¬†No need to reinvent the wheel.
Diversify Revenue Streams:¬†Think beyond placements ‚Äì consulting, data, and insights 
Forge Strategic Partnerships:¬†Team up with powerhouses like The Trade Desk, Criteo, and even connected TV platforms.

Masterclass Insights: Nadine Kamski & Franziska Eickhoff, along with Amazon's Ad Tech Lead DE Cyrus Zaboli, delivered an insightful masterclass on ""Insights to Impact."" They showcased how Amazon & L'Or√©al go beyond advertising. 

Connected Departments = Powerful Insights:¬†Ecommerce, media, and data teams working together unlock a whole new level of understanding.

Amazon Marketing Cloud = Actionable Results:¬†Activating insights through targeted audiences delivers serious impact, especially for always-on campaigns.

48 crazy intensive hours
Several dozen coffees, beers and G&Ts
Hundreds of handshakes
Thousands new ideas!

Started off Tuesday at our partner agency morefire's client day event. Immediately Thorsten Olscha threw me in to their panel discussion on AI (KI in German, and Datenschutz is always an important topic in German)

Daniela Romberg introduced me to Timo Franz to talk about International digital marketing for a B2B2C client.
Dinner with morefire clients and friends - great to meet the people from B. Braun such as Janine P.!
Closing off the eve at VIA Nederland  drinks reception with 175 Dutchies, talking about Retail Media at HelloFresh with genius David Wijland ‚úîÔ∏è and getting to know Susanne Klabbers Personalized Video solution. Agreed with Richard Smoorenburg to catch up over beers Wednesday afternoon - but we forgot!

Day one of Dmexco - brilliant kick-off speech of Robin Heintze with his wisdom of B2B marketing that he wished he'd had 5 years ago.

Exploring many advertising-supported Video On Demand (ASVOD) solutions such as Disney Julia Sch√∂rner who have already 2M such subscribers in Germany.

Explosion of Retail Media solutions - Schwarz Corporate Solutions is moving super fast in this space. Well done Fabian Leitinger, Lidl Netherlands must be eagerly awaiting the roll-out here.

Lunch with Mitch Voskuilen & Milou Rengelink of our attribution & AI performance marketing solution Billy Grace (thanks for sponsoring OM Club and bringing us along!)

Meeting Ernst Dirkzwager of Readpeak - interesting solution, Ibro Karahasanoviƒá should we perhaps give this a chance with a test?

Adform's DSP seems to be doing really well in the cookieless era. Higher match rates for 1st party data and better across browsers (where DV360 might match audiences preferably within Chrome and Android). Thanks for the insights Katja Henneveld and Tessa Johanneke van den Dool.

Softies Matthijs van Heijningen (congrats on ten years Microsoft!) and Sabrina Schmidt - talking about their event next Monday where I'll be a panelist.

Meeting my old prot√©g√© Wicher Schapers who's now rocking it at skydreams with Vin√≠cius Le√£o
Super effective Social tooling Smartly - happy to see our partnership manager Torsten Noack and discuss future growth. Shame I can't be at your event soon, but I'll make sure to send some colleagues :)

Call Tracking in 2013? Not available in the Netherlands, but with Frank G. Froux of matelso GmbH we figured it out and brought it here. Great to see the developments your company has made to bring Marketing and Sales closer to eachother.

Day one of Dmexco a wrap? No no - the OM Club party at Bootshaus (#5 techno club in the world) was crazy good until after 3am üíÄ

I have been dabbling in creating beautiful spaces forever, but my obsession began in earnest when I designed the iconic Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, that was visited by presidents, diplomats, students, farmers  alike, and thousands of others.  

Then the very cool blueMoon incubator space, Addis Garage, fiercely loved by startups across the city. Then the natural evolution to blueSpace, the top co-working space in Ethiopia which opened its doors 5 years ago and has grown massively from 400 to over 2000 sqm and 200+ desks.  

I love how well designed space makes people feel inspired, productive, energized, even happy.

7123248725908430848,"üá∫üá∏¬†What shocked me in the USA.

During my recent travels in the USA, I couldn't help but notice the differences in environmental awareness compared to some other places I've visited. While there's certainly progress and a growing movement towards sustainability, it's clear that environmental considerations might still have some catching up to do in certain areas of the country.

One noticeable aspect was the prevalence of plastic, reminding us of the ongoing challenges associated with single-use plastics. Additionally, there were very few electric cars on the roads, with Teslas being an exception.
I want to relate this to the Black Swan Theory.

The Black Swan Theory, popularized by author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is grounded in the idea that unpredictable and unexpected events, often referred to as ""black swans,"" have a profound impact on our lives and the world.

In this case, ‚ÄúBlack swan"" means that the USA is not aware of what she is doing with her actions. This would mean that the people living there might end up on a garbage dump or poisoning themselves.

What are your thoughts? This isn't just a concern in the USA; many countries worldwide struggle with low environmental awareness. However, larger and more influential countries should serve as role models, don't you think?

The meticulous planning that goes into this event is evident.

The speakers were amazing company to be recognised amongst. 

Highlight sessions included Joao Adao, Azeem Ahmad, Heather Physioc and Greg Gifford, to mention just a few.

The way Andra≈æ ≈†talec and his team look after the speakers is second to none.

The camaraderie between the speakers was brilliant - some of us were friends ahead of the day, many were first introductions - but we all left as friends, keen to stay in touch ‚ù§Ô∏è

My talk was on using behavioural science to master your customer journey. 

I found likeness in a number of the talks - moving towards a more human approach, which for me is critical to a successful strategy.

üëáüèª I have linked my slides below üëáüèª

I was also invited to join a üî• fireside chat üî• hosted by Robert Craven with Ann Stanley (aka Simmonds) and Valentina Pirih to talk about managing clients.

We covered everything from the good, how to make things amazing and what to do when relationships are tested. 

I absolutely love a panel - it is always so interesting to see what others have to say and bounce ideas off of each other in front of an audience. 

Whilst I was there it was also the inaugural inObit awards - where I was a judge and invited to reveal some of the winners.

I practised my words over and over again‚Ä¶ Slovenian is not the easiest language to pronounce for my British tongue üò¨üòÇ

It was fabulous to see such worthy winners celebrate their hard work ‚ù§Ô∏è

Ein aufregender Tag DMEXCO zusammen mit Michael Fischer und Nina Werner liegt hinter mir. Ein paar meiner wichtigsten Learnings:

üí° Kontext ist King: Gen Z will nicht nur Produkte, sondern die Geschichten dahinter.
üí° Modernes Marketing: Echter Marketing-Erfolg entsteht durch das Zusammenspiel von Skills und Technologie.
üí° Omnichannel Integration: Bleibt h√§ufig eine Herausforderung ‚Äì der Loop ist noch nicht ganz geschlossen.

F√ºr KNISTR  am Wichtigsten:

üöÄ Retail Media war mit einer ganzen Halle vertreten und ist vielleicht die Zukunft der Werbung. Es wird erwartet, dass Retail Media bald 20 % der globalen digitalen Advertising Spends ausmacht. Von Awareness bis Conversion ‚Äì jeder Bereich des Marketing Funnels kann durch den Zugang des Handels gezielt bedient werden. Das revolutioniert Gesch√§ftsmodelle im Retail und schafft neue Perspektiven. 

üîë Loyalty-Programme spielen bei Retail Media eine Schl√ºsselrolle: Sie erm√∂glichen den Zugang zu wertvollen Kundendaten und schaffen √ºberhaupt die Grundlage f√ºr zielgerichtete, personalisierte Werbung. Unternehmen wie Amazon, Walmart und in Deutschland speziell Schwarz, OBI, Douglas & REWE nutzen Loyalty-Daten, um Retail Media-Strategien zu st√§rken und ihre Werbeeffizienz zu steigern. Also: Loyalty-Programme sind der Enabler, der Retail Media so kraftvoll macht!

üòÑ Und ganz pers√∂nlich? Die DMEXCO f√ºhlte sich fast wie ein Klassentreffen an ‚Äì bunt, erlebnisreich und voller spannender Begegnungen, gerade auch was Partnering betrifft. Die Fahrt mit dem Autoscooter auf der Messe war definitiv die perfekte Abwechslung!

7245744782151438336,"The Armenia Digital Awards 2024 by ECDMA  and Digital & Ecomm EVN Conference are now behind us. It's a mix of emotions ‚Äì happiness for what we achieved, but also a bit of sadness that it‚Äôs almost over. What's left is preparing press releases, delivering awards to those who couldn't attend, analyzing our mistakes, and figuring out the future of these events.

Some people have asked, ""How much did you earn?"" If we‚Äôre talking money, the answer is simple ‚Äì I earned a significant amount, just with a minus sign in front of it (or as some like to call it, ""substantial negative growth"") üòÑ. But I see it as an investment. An investment in the development of Armenia's market and community.

Thanks to these events, I got to meet so many incredible people ‚Äì people who are great to talk to about life and work, people who are ready to help without expecting anything in return, even offering their support before being asked. These are people with whom I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll create many more projects together.

The conference, which Artak Harutyunyan  (so glad we met and became partners) and I organized from scratch in just a two weeks, saw an incredible turnout. I‚Äôve never seen a conference in Yerevan where, 40 minutes before the start, the hall was already half full. At one point, we had around 200 attendees simultaneously, and considering the flow of people coming and going, there were over 280 participants in total. These are incredible numbers!

The speakers were highly professional, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the audience was actively engaging, not just scrolling on their phones.

Yes, there were some surprising challenges along the way ‚Äì the low engagement from agencies (globally, agencies are typically the main participants, submitting their client work), the hesitation from sponsors, the lack of interest from ministries, and the reluctance of voters to leave written feedback on government services (even though they have plenty to say in person). But these are minor setbacks ‚Äì we'll make it even better next time.

These were my first events where I was the lead organizer. Sure, I‚Äôve often spoken at conferences and been involved in the setup in my corporate life, but this was different. The adrenaline is something I already crave more of, and I completely understand people in the event industry ‚Äì always exhausted, but never giving up.

Thank you to everyone who helped, participated, and attended. Thank you to the jury, the press, new and old friends, and my family.

I‚Äôll write a few more thoughtful posts later, but for now, it‚Äôs all emotions ‚Äì apologies for the long read.

1. Registering for a WeChat account in advance is recommended, as many events require WeChat mini-program registration for convenience. Additionally, WeChat is commonly used for communication within the gaming industry in China.
2. During CJ, getting a taxi near the exhibition hall might be relatively difficult, and the waiting time is usually long. If you have transportation needs, it is advisable to allow enough time between meetings.
Shanghai's end of July is a very hot week, so please take precautions against sunburn and heatstroke.
3. Cash is not commonly needed in China nowadays, so setting up Alipay/WeChat Pay accounts in advance is convenient.

I am very much looking forward to the opportunity for studio leadership from around the world to catch up with us.! üíó

First, I had the pleasure in taking the stage at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference in Germany, where I shared insights on creating a storytelling powerhouse with AI x webinars.

Creating AI-powered visuals has become a passion. 

So many ideas, so many tools, so many creative directions. 

Connecting webinars to these visuals is all about scaling your storytelling and creating sustainable reach. I believe this will be big for B2B/B2C marketing.

Earlier this month, I revisited the contents of this talk in 'The Webinarverse', the yearly online event hosted by WebinarGeek. Hundreds of people enjoyed talks by Leonardo.Ai, Jordie van Rijn üíôüíõ, Kareem Mostafa and PwC.

""Officially"" 
 
Palo Alto Networks created a lot of chatter by not doing things the official way. 
 
I thought about covering the AI event itself, but (to me, a business nerd) their marketing strategy is the interesting part. 
 
I feel like it might end up being sneaky effective. Here's why: 
 
‚Üí An online event reaches buyers who didn't attend the conference (most of them). 
 
""An online event during the week of RSAC? Whaaaaa??!!"" Yeah, seems wild at first, but it's more rational than you'd think. 
 
RSAC draws ~40-50,000 people, and a lot of them work for product or services companies.  They were too busy to attend ‚Äî but from a numbers standpoint, they're the minority.  
 
There are more buyers working their normal cybersecurity jobs this week than attending the conference (including most of my practitioner colleagues ‚Äì all senior leaders ‚Äì who don't attend regularly). 
 
An online event during a week where basically nobody else is doing online events can reach a lot of people. 
 
‚Üí Who said an exhibit has to be a booth or a keynote? 
 
This is what marketing looks like when you deeply question constraints. They're ""exhibiting"" without actually exhibiting. 
 
If you've been to enough conferences, you've seen hundreds of exhibitor booths. How many of them do you remember? Maybe like two. 
 
But if you were in San Francisco, you're probably going to remember the time Palo Alto Networks flew a drone show over the Embarcadero at night and put Keanu Reeves in one of their ads. 
 
‚Üí Different gets people talking. 
 
This wasn't about ignoring the conference. It was about being different than all the other companies who were at the conference. 
 
It's harder than ever to stand out at RSAC. But whether you were there or not, there's a good chance you talked about Palo Alto Networks this week. 
 
They got me to spend two hours thinking about their strategy for free, and this post will probably have five-figure views on LinkedIn. ""Different"" works when it's done well.

In hindsight, this stunt by Palo Alto Networks may or may not end up being a hit. That's the thing about marketing (or any creative work) ‚Äì it's really hard to predict what's going to land or get mocked (or both!).

7242468993922383872,"Retail media is a hot topic at DMEXCO this year, with discussions focusing on both its potential and the challenges it faces. 

Here's my hot take: 

üßó‚ôÄÔ∏è Fragmentation and lack of standardization are major hurdles that need to be overcome to achieve scale. 

üîë Standardization is key for reaching the right audience and leveraging data effectively.

üì∑ Incorporating more video content into campaigns is one way brands can move further up the marketing funnel, capturing a wider audience earlier in their decision-making process. 

üìä Proving the effectiveness of retail media remains a challenge but ultimately, accurate measurement and result reporting are essential for adapting strategies and meeting stakeholder expectations.

üìà Remaining focused and using standardized audience segmentation and custom segments can help target crucial brand KPIs.

Influencers are media - and that's what makes it so complicated. Because they are also individuals who only show their real strength when you look at them individually and let go of the reins.

In Germany, a recent study confirms another interesting turning point. ùêìùê°ùêû ùê¢ùê¶ùê©ùê®ùê´ùê≠ùêöùêßùêúùêû ùê®ùêü ùê¢ùêßùêüùê•ùêÆùêûùêßùêúùêûùê´ùê¨ ùê®ùêß ùê©ùêÆùê´ùêúùê°ùêöùê¨ùê¢ùêßùê† ùêùùêûùêúùê¢ùê¨ùê¢ùê®ùêßùê¨ ùê¢ùê¨ ùêùùêûùêúùê•ùê¢ùêßùê¢ùêßùê† ùêüùê®ùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêüùê¢ùê´ùê¨ùê≠ ùê≠ùê¢ùê¶ùêû. The study looked at the proportion of people who followed recommendations from YouTube or Instagram stars. In 2023, it was 37% and 33% respectively. This year, it fell to 29% for both channels for the first time.

Influencer marketing is seen rationally and taken very seriously at the same time.This also means that influencer activation is now planned, controlled and then monitored and reported just like any other channel.

Influencers are media - and that's what makes it so complicated. Because they are also individuals who only show their real strength when you look at them individually and let go of the reins.

Marketers probably roll their eyes when they hear this question. I often feel the same way. 

The problem? We often don't speak the same language across teams.
The solution? We need to break down the silos we work in.
And how? Marie-Therese, Britta, Thomas, and I will discuss this on Thursday at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference.

It's crazy how time flies. Tomorrow we're off to Cologne. So excited!

This milestone is a testament to our founding team's vision and relentless dedication, which fueled the creation of our flagship M3 platform.

Our narrative took a decisive turn with the rise of multiple currencies. This pivotal moment emphasized the urgent need for new ad metrics paradigms, a domain where our proficiency in advanced planning and forecasting methodologies truly excelled.

Transforming from an ambitious concept to a reality, M3 has redefined industry standards, especially with its adoption by TelevisaUnivision, showcasing our team's creativity and the platform's significance.

As 2024 unfolds, we're excited to welcome two new publishers, further expanding our impact. This journey, more than growth, is a story of unity and transformation driven by our belief in changing the advertising landscape.
