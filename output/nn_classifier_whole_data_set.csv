7042220197381861376,"ASSESSING THE MATURITY LEVEL OF AN ORGANIZATION‚ÄôS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY WHEN HIRING THE RIGHT EXECUTIVE
Organizations will benefit greatly from knowing the maturity level of their digital transformation at the time of hiring any top-level executive; the success of digital transformation initiatives often depends on the leadership of the organization. A high level of digital transformation maturity implies that the organization has already embarked on the digital transformation journey and has made significant progress in implementing digital technologies and processes to improve its operations, enhance customer experience, and stay competitive.
By hiring a top-level executive with experience and expertise in driving digital transformation in highly mature organizations, the organization can leverage their knowledge, skills, and best practices to accelerate its own digital transformation journey. Such executives can help the organization further develop and execute a clear digital strategy, identify and prioritize digital initiatives, build a culture of innovation, and drive organizational change.
On the other hand, if an organization is at a lower level of digital transformation maturity, it may need an executive who has experience in driving digital transformation from the ground up, and who can help build the foundation for digital transformation by establishing the necessary infrastructure, processes,
and culture. 
At CONSULTREE we have developed the DTI ‚Äì Digital Transformation Index assessment to help organizations quickly learn the maturity level before engaging in an executive search process.¬† The 15-minute assessment is applied to both: the Executive Team pre-search and to the short-listed candidates pre-hire.
In summary, assessing the maturity level of a company's digital transformation is essential for hiring the right executive. It helps to identify gaps, set realistic expectations, plan strategically, mitigate risks, and ensure a positive ROI. Without this assessment, a company may hire the wrong executive who is ill-equipped to support or lead the digital transformation efforts. Moreover, the DTI assessment helps ensure that the organization hires an executive with the right skills, experience, and mindset to help drive the organization's digital transformation journey successfully.
For more information about CONSULTREE‚Äôs Digital Transformation Index assessment, please write to us at: consulting@consultree.com

Alhamdullilah, This past February 17th, I had the privilege of being part of a brilliant event in Almaty, Kazakhstan - the Digital Umma IT Forum, hosted at Nur-Mubarak University. It was a pioneering gathering for Muslim tech enthusiasts, attracting over 1600 applications and 1000+ participants. This forum wasn‚Äôt just an event; it was a celebration of innovation, where 30+ expert speakers from leading Islamic startups and top tech companies shared their insights and visions for the future.

The feedback from both speakers and attendees was overwhelmingly positive, with many commending the event's high level of organization and the quality of interactions it facilitated.

In my role as a designer and marketing strategist, I contributed across multiple dimensions: visual identity that included the branding and logo, developing the UI/UX for the event website (digital-umma.com), designing presentations for sponsors and the event's physical decoration. Most importantly I led our marketing on Instagram, with a video invitation that went viral (+43K views), boosting our community to over 3000 followers and ensuring our content, including reels, that consistently received thousands of views. Check our page:

I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this remarkable event and am excited to carry forward the insights and experiences gained as I continue to explore the intersection of design, technology, and social impact.

7242401473328783360,"How Europe is becoming the biggest crypto market globally in 2025?

Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak on this question at #DMEXCO #2024 in Cologne. The simple answer: through regulation - but not only. My key points:

- MiCAR creates a single European market for crypto assets with 448 million citizens and a GDP of 16.97 trillion euros. This is the biggest single regulated market for crypto globally
- The short-term potential of retail crypto offerings is particularly significant. 13% of Germans aged 18-64 are already invested in crypto. In comparison, only 20% are invested in shares and ETFs.¬†
- The long-term potential is even bigger - it's about the tokennization of all types of digital ownership and financial instruments. KPMG forecasts the market for tokenised financial instruments in Europe at 330 billion euros in 2030

If you want to learn more about MiCAR and its potential, read our whitepaper and take the KPMG MiCAR Pulse Check. A simple tool that quickly tells you how your business model is regulated and what requirements apply (link in the comments).

Other speakers discussed the potential of programmable money, web3 and token-based economies. Thank you w3.group, Vicktoria Klich, Jonathan Kuhl, Marvin Hug and Philipp Kielholz for the excellent organisation.

‚úÖ Bespoke pitches to 25 key interested parties
‚úÖ Sold to Aviva: 1 x Naming rights partner. 1x Skills and Training 1 x Sustainability partnership.
¬†
These types of partnerships are complex and challenging therefore having a clear process is key to success.

¬†
I had the pleasure¬†of consulting and delivering the naming rights partner for Manchester City Council and Factory International for what is now called Aviva Studios.
¬†
It took just shy of 3 years to build a strategy, align key stakeholders, and go to market, which culminated in securing an incredible 10-year partnership with Aviva.
¬†
Here are some of the achievements.¬†
¬†
‚úÖ Developed saleable Naming Rights assets from scratch for the venue & Factory international
‚úÖ Valuations of assets
‚úÖ Created an ethical and governance framework
‚úÖ Implemented an integrated strategy to ensure internal collaboration
‚úÖ Built alliances and contracts to ensure accountability
‚úÖ Created commercial assets
‚úÖ Executed a robust brand targeting strategy
‚úÖ Outreach and cultivation +250 brands
‚úÖ Bespoke pitches to 25 key interested parties
‚úÖ Sold to Aviva: 1 x Naming rights partner. 1x Skills and Training 1 x Sustainability partnership.
¬†
These types of partnerships are complex and challenging therefore having a clear process is key to success.
¬†
To aide other projects I have created a detailed commercial playbook that includes my experiences and learnings, which I am sharing with rights holders.

Playbook inclusions: 
¬†
üèüÔ∏è Venue Asset Strategy
ü§ù Sponsorship Asset Development
üí∞ Asset Valuations
üìä Sales Presentation Requirements
üéØ Brand Targeting and Due Diligence
üöÄ Go-to-Market Strategy
ü§ù Client Cultivation & Pitching
¬†‚úÖ Closing Deals

Just wrapped up an incredible experience at DMEXCO 2024, and I‚Äôm more inspired than ever! This year‚Äôs theme, ""Prompting the Future,"" couldn‚Äôt be more fitting. From the masterclasses to the keynote speeches, every moment was a powerful reminder of how far AI has come in just one year.

The energy and innovation at this year‚Äôs conference were palpable, and the discussions around AI are no longer about what‚Äôs possible‚Äîthey‚Äôre about what‚Äôs *already* happening. I was blown away by how quickly AI is reshaping industries, unlocking new creative potentials, and driving business strategies forward. üöÄ

One of my personal highlights was the keynote with DeepL and a marketing mastermind who shared insights from his experience working with Berghain. It was amazing to be surrounded by so many inspiring, motivated, and committed disciples of the AI discipline. A major takeaway: ""Reach is Religion"" is the new ""Content is King."" We‚Äôre in a new era, and it's thrilling to witness the shift!

What struck me most was how AI isn't replacing us‚Äîit's enhancing our abilities. We‚Äôre not just using AI; we‚Äôre learning to *work with it*, expanding our skills and reaching new heights of innovation. The future is bright, and I‚Äôm excited for what's next as we continue to explore how humans and AI can build a world full of possibilities, together. ü§ñ‚ú®

Fascinating insights, sage advice and a few choice words to an obnoxious lawyer. 

Thank you for all you continue to do for females in our industry.

GingerMay #ATMYS Mary Keane-Dawson","In life, fortunes twist and turn. Where I‚Äôve arrived was very different from where I started. 
By the time I was ready for my first media job, I had had a baby and was desperate to earn money so I could get out of my council flat. I was 22 years-old. 
What would I tell myself back then, if I could? That was what @VictoriaUsher asked me for  GingerMay Marketing & PR  Advice to My Younger Self series, which gives career starters the chance to learn from senior leaders‚Äô experiences. 
The question took me back to when I was sent a job ad by an ex-boyfriend, Patrick Chaundy  who worked at The Express Newspaper. It was for ad sales, selling classifieds at The Guardian (‚Äúafter all‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúyou're quite left wing‚Äù...). 
Inspired by his confidence in me, I applied for the role and a similar one at The Observer. I will always remember my interview for The Guardian with @CarolineMarland. She handed me an ashtray and asked me to sell it to her. 

I failed miserably. 

A few days later,I had my interview at @The Observer, where I met @RhonaDrummond; she gave me my big chance, saying I should sell semi-display and skip the classifieds role. By then I had learned how to sell an ashtray. My schtick must have been impressive.
Being interviewed by two (the only two) female senior leaders on Fleet Street in 1986 meant I assumed this was a career path where women could get to the top and earn fantastic money. It seemed to be a meritocracy and that appealed to me. 
I was blessed to witness Fleet Street‚Äôs end and be at the heart of the media revolution delivered through desktop publishing. It was a chaotic, creative, and explosive time to be alive and to be working in our industry. 
I loved it. I grabbed every opportunity, being lucky enough to convince some incredibly senior male clients, such as Sir Ian McAllister, to back me. 
This was a time when a senior female would be the only girl in the leadership gang. I realise now how difficult it was to succeed in this environment, but I was never going (to) back down.
Often on this journey, I have felt lonely. I‚Äôve been surprised and disappointed at how my success upsets people, making some men quite angry. 
While trying to buy @Spafax, a very posh lawyer from the sell side screamed at me in a meeting,""Who the fuck are you to buy Spafax?"" The room fell silent after. I sat there patiently and quietly, and thought, 'You've just fucked up, Mr Lawyer - we have all the cards now‚Äô Staying calm and carrying on, that‚Äôs my super power.

I'd say to the young Mary Keane-Dawson, who made it to be an MD by 27 and went on to buy and sell several agencies, plus reconstruct a few more ‚Äî well done. Congratulations. I'm very glad you stuck with it and never compromised yourself or your beliefs. Today you're surrounded by a wonderful family and fantastic friends, many of whom are former colleagues and clients. And you've helped pave the way for more female leaders.
Not a bad run at it, when all is said and done.",2023-05-02T11:10:29.195Z,no,2023-05-02,"post date: 2023-05-02 Thank you Mary Keane-Dawson for your Advice To My Younger Self.

‚ÄúWatching how we all came together as a global network to turn this around in a matter of days, from brief to going live, gave me goosebumps. It brought back memories of ‚ÄòCourage is Beautiful, and I‚Äôm sure this will have just as much impact. #turnyourback was a truly integrated campaign in every sense, developed within hours by Ogilvy UK and DAVID Madrid, with production assistance from DAVID S√£o Paulo. From the outset we leveraged earned, social, influence and creativity, all working in perfect harmony to maximum effect. Filters like Bold Glamour might feel like a bit of fun - but they are potent tools that are destroying the self-esteem of millions of young girls. We have to take a stand.‚Äù

I want to express my gratitude to Ana √Ålvarez - Founder and CEO of Migrapreneur ¬Æ for inviting me to participate in the panel discussion. It was an honor to share my journey and discuss the challenges I've faced as a migrant in Germany. Being part of such a meaningful conversation was a privilege.
I am deeply thankful to Migrapreneur for awarding me two scholarships through Coursera last year, specifically in UX Design and Digital Marketing and E-commerce. These opportunities not only enriched my skill set but also opened up new possibilities in my professional path. Being part of the Migrapreneur community has truly been a game-changer.

During the workshop sessions, I had the opportunity to attend Pedro Duarte's workshop, where he shared valuable insights into creating the podcast ""La Vida de Nosotros"" in Germany. The session was interesting and inspiring, offering a unique perspective on storytelling in a new cultural context.

Microsoft est√° llevando su tecnolog√≠a publicitaria al siguiente nivel con las √∫ltimas actualizaciones de¬†Copilot AI, un avance significativo en la personalizaci√≥n de anuncios y la creaci√≥n de experiencias publicitarias interactivas. Estas nuevas funciones permiten a las marcas no solo optimizar sus campa√±as, sino tambi√©n crear contenido m√°s relevante y ajustado a las preferencias individuales de cada usuario.

Gracias a la integraci√≥n de inteligencia artificial m√°s avanzada, los anunciantes ahora tienen la capacidad de generar experiencias que capturan la atenci√≥n y generan mejores resultados en todas las plataformas digitales. Copilot AI facilita el dise√±o de anuncios m√°s inteligentes y efectivos, al tiempo que ofrece una mayor flexibilidad en la ejecuci√≥n de estrategias publicitarias.

Principales beneficios:
Personalizaci√≥n a gran escala: Las marcas pueden ajustar sus anuncios en tiempo real seg√∫n las interacciones del usuario, maximizando la relevancia.
Optimizaci√≥n continua: La IA aprende y adapta los anuncios autom√°ticamente, mejorando el rendimiento sin intervenci√≥n manual.
Interactividad mejorada: Los usuarios pueden participar en experiencias m√°s din√°micas, lo que incrementa el engagement y las conversiones.
Con estas mejoras, Microsoft reafirma su compromiso con la transformaci√≥n digital de la publicidad, ofreciendo herramientas potentes que facilitan la conexi√≥n con las audiencias y permiten a los anunciantes destacar en un mercado cada vez m√°s competitivo.

¬øSu marca est√° preparada para aprovechar al m√°ximo la inteligencia artificial en la publicidad?¬†El futuro de la publicidad digital ya est√° aqu√≠, y Copilot AI es una pieza clave de esta evoluci√≥n.

7084916245170450433,"For promotions nerds like me, Amazon Prime Day is pretty exciting.

Here are a couple of takeaways so far: 

üéØ Lots of personalization attempts (and I‚Äôve read mostly good reviews of their personalization progress this year), but mine are still wildly off the mark. My top recommendations today? A carseat, and a pair of women's beach shoes. I am a childless, carless man in a landlocked city. ""WOW Offers"" indeed üòÇ Anyone else?

‚úâÔ∏è The invitation-only offers are quite clever. Here's the deal: you have to express intent to even be ""invited"" to get an offer. It seems to just be a superficial thing (I got invited to all the deals I tried), but I love the idea that a user has to actually say ""Yeah, I want this offer!"" to get the deal. This builds a brilliant sense of exclusivity / scarcity for the offers. VERY smart.

ü•¥ Search & navigation on this site just get worse & worse. I scroll past a ton of junk to find the ""Kitchen"" offers, click ""Kitchen,"" then have to scroll past 6 rows of vacuum cleaners...

So in short, some smart new promotions tactics, but mostly more examples of Amazon's ensh*ttification & ""Day 2"" culture. Quite a different business from the Amazon of the past, with pretty run-of-the-mill prices and fulfillment and soooo much junk!

I can't stop thinking about how Victor Castro described Amazon on Rick Watson's podcast this week from a brand perspective: 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an overcrowded, really busy shopping mall with a ton of traffic. But I‚Äôm really not interested in paying rent at this mall. I am happy to stand at the door with a flier about my product, but don't want to pay rent for a store.""

Overall, clicking around the Prime Day offers has built my optimism that retailers have a fighting chance to claw more and more revenue back from Amazon. I really think these issues (bad experience, bad quality) are foundational and have totally eclipsed the company‚Äôs once legendary customer centricity & ability to innovate.

Would love to hear your notes on Prime Day. Just after I get back from driving my non-existent child in my non-existent car for a swim at our non-existent local beach.

7114579525786550273,"üöÄ DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference was an incredible event, and I'm excited to share my thoughts!

I was amazed by the presence of numerous retailers at the conference, such as OBI Group Holding, OTTO, and Lidl in Germany. It felt more like a retail event than a marketing and tech-focused conference. Of course, there were also many exhibitors showcasing the #eCommerce industry! üõçÔ∏è

In the startup valley, I noticed several services dedicated to eCommerce, including analytics, ad campaign optimization, A/B testing, creative work, post-view and post-click optimization, conversions, and attributions. This was a significant highlight compared to previous years.

I want to emphasize the industry's growing trend of retail and AI. One of the talks that stood out to me was by Birk Angermann from Shopify. The ""Imagine the AI-Powered Future of Commerce"" was genuinely captivating. It delved into how cutting-edge technology could shape the future of most businesses.

The conference attracted many attendees, giving it a genuinely European vibe. It was great to see business partners and people I know personally there. While I had the opportunity to attend some fantastic speakers and live meetings on the first day, the second day was dedicated to networking and connecting with my business partners ü§ù

The only downside was that some talks were conducted in German without English translation, making it challenging to understand the content. However, overall, it was an amazing conference, and I'm already looking forward to attending next year! üéâ

7245744782151438336,"The Armenia Digital Awards 2024 by ECDMA  and Digital & Ecomm EVN Conference are now behind us. It's a mix of emotions ‚Äì happiness for what we achieved, but also a bit of sadness that it‚Äôs almost over. What's left is preparing press releases, delivering awards to those who couldn't attend, analyzing our mistakes, and figuring out the future of these events.

Some people have asked, ""How much did you earn?"" If we‚Äôre talking money, the answer is simple ‚Äì I earned a significant amount, just with a minus sign in front of it (or as some like to call it, ""substantial negative growth"") üòÑ. But I see it as an investment. An investment in the development of Armenia's market and community.

Thanks to these events, I got to meet so many incredible people ‚Äì people who are great to talk to about life and work, people who are ready to help without expecting anything in return, even offering their support before being asked. These are people with whom I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll create many more projects together.

The conference, which Artak Harutyunyan  (so glad we met and became partners) and I organized from scratch in just a two weeks, saw an incredible turnout. I‚Äôve never seen a conference in Yerevan where, 40 minutes before the start, the hall was already half full. At one point, we had around 200 attendees simultaneously, and considering the flow of people coming and going, there were over 280 participants in total. These are incredible numbers!

The speakers were highly professional, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the audience was actively engaging, not just scrolling on their phones.

Yes, there were some surprising challenges along the way ‚Äì the low engagement from agencies (globally, agencies are typically the main participants, submitting their client work), the hesitation from sponsors, the lack of interest from ministries, and the reluctance of voters to leave written feedback on government services (even though they have plenty to say in person).

",,2024-09-28T10:42:55.468Z,no,2024-09-28,"post date: 2024-09-28 The Armenia Digital Awards 2024 by ECDMA  and Digital & Ecomm EVN Conference are now behind us. It's a mix of emotions ‚Äì happiness for what we achieved, but also a bit of sadness that it‚Äôs almost over. What's left is preparing press releases, delivering awards to those who couldn't attend, analyzing our mistakes, and figuring out the future of these events.

Some people have asked, ""How much did you earn?"" If we‚Äôre talking money, the answer is simple ‚Äì I earned a significant amount, just with a minus sign in front of it (or as some like to call it, ""substantial negative growth"") üòÑ. But I see it as an investment. An investment in the development of Armenia's market and community.

Thanks to these events, I got to meet so many incredible people ‚Äì people who are great to talk to about life and work, people who are ready to help without expecting anything in return, even offering their support before being asked. These are people with whom I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll create many more projects together.

The conference, which Artak Harutyunyan  (so glad we met and became partners) and I organized from scratch in just a two weeks, saw an incredible turnout. I‚Äôve never seen a conference in Yerevan where, 40 minutes before the start, the hall was already half full. At one point, we had around 200 attendees simultaneously, and considering the flow of people coming and going, there were over 280 participants in total. These are incredible numbers!

The speakers were highly professional, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the audience was actively engaging, not just scrolling on their phones.

Yes, there were some surprising challenges along the way ‚Äì the low engagement from agencies (globally, agencies are typically the main participants, submitting their client work), the hesitation from sponsors, the lack of interest from ministries, and the reluctance of voters to leave written feedback on government services (even though they have plenty to say in person).

While our team is attending the INBOUND event in Boston, I took a wee break to enjoy the Italian Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Temple of Speed.

Attending reminded me not only how much I love F1 but also of all the business lessons one can learn from this sport.

F1 is a prime example of:
ü§ù Great teamwork - the driver and the team need to trust each other, communicate openly, and work together seamlessly
üß© The importance of strategy - you can have the fastest car in the world but a wrong strategic decision can get you off the podium (cough Ferrari cough)
üåä Adaptability - teams have to embrace change as anything from the weather to accidental contact can affect their performance
üîÑ Continuous optimisation - by collecting and analysing their data the teams are able to improve their performance, even in real-time

Der Creativity Summit auf der DMEXCO

Seit unserem Brainstorming Ende 2023 war Anke und Matthias begeistert von der Idee eines Summits, der sich ausschlie√ülich der Kreativit√§t in der Digitalbranche widmet. DMEXCO hat sich stets entlang der gesamten Wertsch√∂pfungskette der Digital-Marketing-Industrie entwickelt, aber echte, durchdringende Kreativit√§t war oft nur ein Nebenschauplatz. Heute, auch angesichts der durch KI ausgel√∂sten Dynamiken, wird die Bedeutung von authentischer, einzigartiger Kreativit√§t in Kampagnen und Markenaktivit√§ten immer klarer. Sie muss sich wie ein roter Faden durchziehen, sonst wird sie in der Flut der Inhalte untergehen.

Es ist gro√üartig zu sehen, wie dieser erste Schritt zusammen mit Branchenf√ºhrern gelungen ist. Wir sind gespannt, wohin uns diese Reise bis 2025 f√ºhren wird!

7175665003633549312,"Just back from Modex 2024 in Atlanta, USA, and wow, it was an incredible experience! Taking the time to attend this event has left me both glad and fulfilled. üåü

Modex brought together a melting pot of supply chain professionals, technologists, and innovators from across the globe, offering a rare glimpse into the diverse solutions and products shaping our industry. Here are some personal key takeaways that really stood out to me:

**Global Solutions to Local Problems: Many of the challenges we face locally have already been addressed by the West, offering relatable case studies and insights that are directly applicable to our work.

**Beyond Innovation: The adoption of cutting-edge warehouse automation technologies like ASRS, AMRs, and AGVs isn't just about an innovative mindset. Factors like labor and storage costs, along with labor shortages, are pushing the industry towards these solutions at an accelerated pace.

**Software Reigns Supreme: The backbone of successful hardware turnkey projects is highly flexible, reliable, and scalable software technology. It's clear that in the realm of supply chain solutions, software still wears the crown.

 **Top-tier Talks: The quality of the presentations at Modex was unparalleled. It was a privilege to hear from professionals who have not only devised but also implemented groundbreaking solutions, offering clear and insightful articulations of their work.

 **AI‚Äôs Untapped Potential: The exploration of AI in supply chain management is still in its infancy, presenting a vast field of opportunity for innovation and application.

**A Call to Action for SMEs: The current landscape of supply chain technology often overlooks SMEs due to cost barriers, highlighting a significant opportunity for India to develop cost-effective solutions tailored to their needs.

Attending Modex 2024 was an insightful journey that has broadened my perspective and fueled my excitement for the future of supply chain innovation. The convergence of diverse ideas and solutions at this event was truly inspiring, underscoring the dynamic nature of our industry. Can't wait to see how we can apply these learnings to make a tangible impact!

After a short break the last weeks as of time-intensive offline events and vacation on my end, I am happy to continue this series about #partnermanagement.

Partner management is in general at the front row within the industry it is operating for several reasons. Researching the #industry and #market is necessary to develop the right understanding of the various players and #stakeholders the organization is surrounded by.
Searching for potential new #partnerhips and developing #relationships is one crucial functionality of partner management.
Whether these partnerships are #strategic, #service, or #sales partnerships is of secondary importance for the time being. The underlying function here is in each case #businessdevelopment. 
Once the relationship with the #partner is established, the focus is often on #leadgeneration. Again, this is a form of business development. 
Does this mean that partner management is business development? 
Business development lies at the heart of effective partner management. Without business development, partnerships can't be developed or used to their full potential. Partner management is, therefore, an important part of the organization's general business development and contributes to its general #success.

Recently I have received a lot of positive feedback on this post series. I am glad to know that my posts are actually read and help partner management #colleagues.

A big thanks to the team that made it happen (Annabel de Kort, Ellis Nieuwlaat, Tom van Beers, Annemarije D√©rog√©e-Pikaar, Ingrid Schermer- Jannink, Jos Suijkens, Aziza Bendouch and Martijn Jansen) and all the colleagues for joining us on this journey. I am looking forward to put the pedal to the metal with all of them.

From the noticeable absence of major social media players to some organizational hurdles on the ground, I‚Äôm left wondering - has DMEXCO started losing its edge? ü§î Still, there were valuable takeaways around B2B marketing, AI innovations, and the power of personalization for boosting sales.

üåèWhen I was little, growing up in a small town,¬†I was told that the farthest place I could travel was Russia. So I joined a Russian club to get myself ready. After the wall came down, I learned more languages (English, Spanish, French) and have traveled 66 countries by now including Russia.

üé§As a teenager, I was told that I might not get to study despite my A grades because¬†of my family's non-conformist views in communist East Germany. In 1988, my application to study international business was rejected, another reason why I took part in the peaceful revolution in 1989 joining my pharmacist dad speaking in front of thousands about environmental pollution in the GDR.

In 1990, I was among the first generation of students that joined a Western German university even before Germany was officially reunited. Later I used my business sense to work at world class international companies like Procter & Gamble, Merck, Google, Stada.¬†Like my dad, I go on stages to speak up and ignite transformation. I am happy to support Yunus Social Business and Generation CEO to drive more of that for business and our society.

Why am I sharing this? Because there might be a little or not so little girl out there who is wondering which borders she can cross.
Because 70% of girls feel more confident about their future
after hearing from female role models. 

Why am I telling you this?
