7042220197381861376,"ASSESSING THE MATURITY LEVEL OF AN ORGANIZATION’S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY WHEN HIRING THE RIGHT EXECUTIVE
Organizations will benefit greatly from knowing the maturity level of their digital transformation at the time of hiring any top-level executive; the success of digital transformation initiatives often depends on the leadership of the organization. A high level of digital transformation maturity implies that the organization has already embarked on the digital transformation journey and has made significant progress in implementing digital technologies and processes to improve its operations, enhance customer experience, and stay competitive.
By hiring a top-level executive with experience and expertise in driving digital transformation in highly mature organizations, the organization can leverage their knowledge, skills, and best practices to accelerate its own digital transformation journey. Such executives can help the organization further develop and execute a clear digital strategy, identify and prioritize digital initiatives, build a culture of innovation, and drive organizational change.
On the other hand, if an organization is at a lower level of digital transformation maturity, it may need an executive who has experience in driving digital transformation from the ground up, and who can help build the foundation for digital transformation by establishing the necessary infrastructure, processes,
and culture. 
At CONSULTREE we have developed the DTI – Digital Transformation Index assessment to help organizations quickly learn the maturity level before engaging in an executive search process.  The 15-minute assessment is applied to both: the Executive Team pre-search and to the short-listed candidates pre-hire.
In summary, assessing the maturity level of a company's digital transformation is essential for hiring the right executive. It helps to identify gaps, set realistic expectations, plan strategically, mitigate risks, and ensure a positive ROI. Without this assessment, a company may hire the wrong executive who is ill-equipped to support or lead the digital transformation efforts. Moreover, the DTI assessment helps ensure that the organization hires an executive with the right skills, experience, and mindset to help drive the organization's digital transformation journey successfully.
For more information about CONSULTREE’s Digital Transformation Index assessment, please write to us at: consulting@consultree.com

Alhamdullilah, This past February 17th, I had the privilege of being part of a brilliant event in Almaty, Kazakhstan - the Digital Umma IT Forum, hosted at Nur-Mubarak University. It was a pioneering gathering for Muslim tech enthusiasts, attracting over 1600 applications and 1000+ participants. This forum wasn’t just an event; it was a celebration of innovation, where 30+ expert speakers from leading Islamic startups and top tech companies shared their insights and visions for the future.

The feedback from both speakers and attendees was overwhelmingly positive, with many commending the event's high level of organization and the quality of interactions it facilitated.

In my role as a designer and marketing strategist, I contributed across multiple dimensions: visual identity that included the branding and logo, developing the UI/UX for the event website (digital-umma.com), designing presentations for sponsors and the event's physical decoration. Most importantly I led our marketing on Instagram, with a video invitation that went viral (+43K views), boosting our community to over 3000 followers and ensuring our content, including reels, that consistently received thousands of views. Check our page: 

https://lnkd.in/gAvHjq6d

I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this remarkable event and am excited to carry forward the insights and experiences gained as I continue to explore the intersection of design, technology, and social impact.

7242401473328783360,"How Europe is becoming the biggest crypto market globally in 2025?

Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak on this question at #DMEXCO #2024 in Cologne. The simple answer: through regulation - but not only. My key points:

- MiCAR creates a single European market for crypto assets with 448 million citizens and a GDP of 16.97 trillion euros. This is the biggest single regulated market for crypto globally
- The short-term potential of retail crypto offerings is particularly significant. 13% of Germans aged 18-64 are already invested in crypto. In comparison, only 20% are invested in shares and ETFs. 
- The long-term potential is even bigger - it's about the tokennization of all types of digital ownership and financial instruments. KPMG forecasts the market for tokenised financial instruments in Europe at 330 billion euros in 2030

If you want to learn more about MiCAR and its potential, read our whitepaper and take the KPMG MiCAR Pulse Check. A simple tool that quickly tells you how your business model is regulated and what requirements apply (link in the comments).

Other speakers discussed the potential of programmable money, web3 and token-based economies. Thank you w3.group, Vicktoria Klich, Jonathan Kuhl, Marvin Hug and Philipp Kielholz for the excellent organisation.

I've always thought (but struggled to respect it) that you need to stay at least three years in a role to have an impact. In one of my previous assignments, I even went as far as to commit publicly to it because I felt the team was tired of so many leadership changes.

Alright, so the three years thing probably holds true for business but there is one element where you don't need to wait three years: PEOPLE. Or at least that's the way the CTS Finance team made me feel ❤😭 during my last townhall. I was deeply touched by the messages I heard and I wish all of you to experience this feeling at least once in your career.

“A conference without a killer party is like pancakes without the maple syrup. Like gin without the tonic. Like rock without the roll. In other words, no conference is complete without one.

And to a good end … As I always remind clients, “No deals were ever forged in the main speaking hall. They begin with an intro, with a drink, with a “Have you met … Ted?””

Having said all that, there are parties, and then there’s the OMClub party that the folks from PIRATE Summit host on the night of DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference in Cologne, Germany. …

Now, I’m not going to tell you that the OMClub party is the best one I’ve ever been too, because it’s not. But it IS the best business related party I’ve ever seen.“

OMClub is happening in two weeks again. Doors will open September 20th at 9pm. 🕺

See you there! 🥳

PS: Picture taken by Dan. If you are looking for a great photographer, reach out to him. He is good!!

🎉

Reminder: Tickets for OMClub are not for sale. Ask one of the sponsors (you can find them on the website) or follow OMClub here on LinkedIn and participate in one of the raffles. Or, of course, become one of the sponsors with your company and get in front of 3,000 decision makers of the digital industry.

7242515297998356481,Huge thank you to our trusted Partner Siemens and Charis Endres for co-hosting a Masterclass at the DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference. We discussed the importance of visual communication to accelerate business growth. It was great to share our successful journey and it is incredible to see our partners flourish and see the impact and value of Canva across their teams.,"🌟 What an amazing experience! 🌟

Today, I had the privilege of co-hosting a Masterclass at DMEXCO with our trusted partner, Canva  🎉

Our journey in the global talent attraction team started with a small pilot, and it blossomed into a powerful tool for implementing our Employer Brand on a global scale. We uncovered the astounding fact that visual content is 40 times more likely to be remembered, highlighting just how crucial a strong Employer Brand is to attract top talent and how a graphic Design Platform like Canva can support that. 

A huge thanks to everyone who participated!

🤝At Valtech, we don’t just talk about partnerships — we live them. 
From the very beginning, I was convinced by Valtech's approach to building meaningful, long-term collaborations. They don’t just focus on technology or sales; they prioritize a shared culture and vision with their partners. This commitment to true partnership is what sets Valtech apart.

Recently, I had the opportunity to see this firsthand when we brought together experts from five leading companies—Tetyana Keyvan from commercetools, Roberto Vlad from Contentstack, Philip Geiger from Algolia, Karl Morgan from inriver, and Markus Cansever from Valtech. 

📈Our joint goal? To collaborate on a proposal that would help our joint client elevate their digital commerce landscape .

As I look forward to DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference next week, this meeting wasn’t just fun — it was the kind of collaboration I want to embrace in the future. The energy, expertise, and shared commitment we had today is exactly how I envision working going forward. A special thanks to every attendee for contributing to this inspiring session. 

However, success in such a collaboration doesn’t come without its challenges.

Partnerships are not about short-term gains. They require trust, transparency, and loyalty. Valtech’s commitment to fostering these principles ensures that every partner is fully invested in delivering the best outcomes, making each collaboration a long-term success 🔖

Finding the right people within your own organization is just as important as working with external partners. Valtech’s internal experts, Bertrand Payet and Samuel Geiger, brought unique insights that helped align our efforts with those of our partners, ensuring we deliver exceptional value to the client 💼.

This collaborative effort wasn’t just about combining tools—it was about uniting people and ideas across five companies to achieve one common goal 🎯.

Thanks for the invitation and the exciting conversation!","Rising to the # 1 in the app charts

There are many football apps for professionals. And now there is one for the ""real football“ - the amateur game played and loved by 190 million Europeans.

Lukas Röhle co-founded Prematch App with Fiete Grünter und niklas brackmann. This year, the three amateur footballer players stormed the app charts. Shortly after its rollout across Germany last summer, the football community app climbed to the No 1 spot in the Apple app charts, ahead of YouTube, TikTok and WhatsApp. The app offers players and fans everything they need to know about amateur football, even allowing them to check their own market value and performance data.

🎻 How to orchestrate a launch that makes you the # 1 app
⚽️ Why founding a football team was key to achieving message-market fit
💸 What innovative ways the team used to communicate with their angel investors

7242776325021732864,"🌟 **Prompting the Future: A Glimpse into the AI-Driven World at DMEXCO 2024** 🌟

Just wrapped up an incredible experience at DMEXCO 2024, and I’m more inspired than ever! This year’s theme, ""Prompting the Future,"" couldn’t be more fitting. From the masterclasses to the keynote speeches, every moment was a powerful reminder of how far AI has come in just one year.

The energy and innovation at this year’s conference were palpable, and the discussions around AI are no longer about what’s possible—they’re about what’s *already* happening. I was blown away by how quickly AI is reshaping industries, unlocking new creative potentials, and driving business strategies forward. 🚀

One of my personal highlights was the keynote with DeepL and a marketing mastermind who shared insights from his experience working with Berghain.

Just wrapped up an incredible experience at DMEXCO 2024, and I’m more inspired than ever! This year’s theme, ""Prompting the Future,"" couldn’t be more fitting. From the masterclasses to the keynote speeches, every moment was a powerful reminder of how far AI has come in just one year.

The energy and innovation at this year’s conference were palpable, and the discussions around AI are no longer about what’s possible—they’re about what’s *already* happening. I was blown away by how quickly AI is reshaping industries, unlocking new creative potentials, and driving business strategies forward. 🚀

One of my personal highlights was the keynote with DeepL and a marketing mastermind who shared insights from his experience working with Berghain. It was amazing to be surrounded by so many inspiring, motivated, and committed disciples of the AI discipline. A major takeaway: ""Reach is Religion"" is the new ""Content is King.""

7239177363773693952,"""Nina, sehen wir uns eigentlich auf der DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference?"" Diese Frage bekomme ich aktuell ziemlich oft gestellt, denn ich war dazu bislang doch recht still – und wer mich kennt, weiß, dass ""still sein"" eigentlich nicht so mein Ding ist. 😉

Also, für alle, die sich gefragt haben: Ja, ich bin natürlich auf der #DMEXCO2024!

Was steht auf meinem Plan?
👉 Keynote: Wer Bock hat, ohne Bullshit-Bingo echtes KI-Handwerk und Strategie rund um angewandte künstliche Intelligenz zu erleben und zu verstehen, der muss die Keynote von Experience One CEO Kai Henrik Müller am 18.9. um 12:30 Uhr auf der Agency Stage anhören. Ich habe die Ehre, mit diesem unfassbar schlauen Typen und dem noch schlaueren Team dahinter zusammenzuarbeiten, und naja, man könnte sagen, ich bin biased, aber nein, ich meine es ernst: Es lohnt sich, ihr Mäuse!

👉 Standbesuche & Co: Ich empfehle die organisierten Talks von ODALINE & Jan Nicolas König beim Next Agency Summit, bin sehr gespannt auf die Moderation von Kim Alexandra Notz im Gespräch mit TikTok und freue mich auf die wundervolle Aissu Diallo und das Thema #socialfirst – und natürlich die Partys danach. Hab gehört, auf dem Stand von Adform gibt’s Kölsch und Currywurst? 😋

👉 Networking with me: Natürlich freue ich mich auf den Austausch abseits all der Keynotes, Stände und Schlaubi-Sessions. Wer spontan auf ein leckeres Kaltgetränk vorbeikommen möchte: Ich bin dieses Jahr mal wieder in GWA-Mission unterwegs. In diesem Jahr gibt’s einen GWA Wissens-Shuttle! Wir shuttlen den ganzen Tag und daher findet ihr mich eigentlich immer vor dem Eingang Nord – unschwer zu erkennen an einem ""unauffälligen"", gelben American School Bus, den wir zum GWA Shuttle umgebaut haben.

🚌 Was geht da so? Am Tag 1 der DMEXCO habt ihr die Möglichkeit, ab 11 Uhr ab dem Eingang Nord in unser Shuttle einzusteigen. Wir pendeln euch zwischen maximaler DMEXCO-Inspirations-Power und großartigem First-Hand Praxis-Know-how aus unserer GWA-Community zu den drei großen E’s: #Engagement, #Entertainment und #Experience.

Was euch erwartet? Was fürs 🧠 Hirn (#Brain-Food), was für den 🍲 🍹  Gaumen (leckeres #Food und #Drinks) und was zum Mitnehmen 🎁  (#Goodiebag)! 🎉

Warum? Lasst uns über die neuesten Themen unserer Branche sprechen und so #gemeinsam die #Zukunft gestalten. Denn nur, wenn wir zusammenarbeiten, können wir die aktuellen gesellschaftlichen Herausforderungen meistern und Digitale Transformation & Innovationen vorantreiben. Danke an den Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW) e.V., ohne den Support wäre der Shuttle  nicht möglich gewesen. Schön, dass wir gemeinsam die Branche weiterentwickeln können!

Fascinating insights, sage advice and a few choice words to an obnoxious lawyer. 

Thank you for all you continue to do for females in our industry.

GingerMay #ATMYS Mary Keane-Dawson","In life, fortunes twist and turn. Where I’ve arrived was very different from where I started. 
By the time I was ready for my first media job, I had had a baby and was desperate to earn money so I could get out of my council flat. I was 22 years-old. 
What would I tell myself back then, if I could? That was what @VictoriaUsher asked me for  GingerMay Marketing & PR  Advice to My Younger Self series, which gives career starters the chance to learn from senior leaders’ experiences. 
The question took me back to when I was sent a job ad by an ex-boyfriend, Patrick Chaundy  who worked at The Express Newspaper. It was for ad sales, selling classifieds at The Guardian (“after all”, he said, “you're quite left wing”...). 
Inspired by his confidence in me, I applied for the role and a similar one at The Observer. I will always remember my interview for The Guardian with @CarolineMarland. She handed me an ashtray and asked me to sell it to her. 

I failed miserably. 

A few days later,I had my interview at @The Observer, where I met @RhonaDrummond; she gave me my big chance, saying I should sell semi-display and skip the classifieds role. By then I had learned how to sell an ashtray. My schtick must have been impressive.
Being interviewed by two (the only two) female senior leaders on Fleet Street in 1986 meant I assumed this was a career path where women could get to the top and earn fantastic money. It seemed to be a meritocracy and that appealed to me. 
I was blessed to witness Fleet Street’s end and be at the heart of the media revolution delivered through desktop publishing. It was a chaotic, creative, and explosive time to be alive and to be working in our industry. 
I loved it. I grabbed every opportunity, being lucky enough to convince some incredibly senior male clients, such as Sir Ian McAllister, to back me. 
This was a time when a senior female would be the only girl in the leadership gang. I realise now how difficult it was to succeed in this environment, but I was never going (to) back down.
Often on this journey, I have felt lonely. I’ve been surprised and disappointed at how my success upsets people, making some men quite angry. 
While trying to buy @Spafax, a very posh lawyer from the sell side screamed at me in a meeting,""Who the fuck are you to buy Spafax?"" The room fell silent after. I sat there patiently and quietly, and thought, 'You've just fucked up, Mr Lawyer - we have all the cards now’ Staying calm and carrying on, that’s my super power.

I'd say to the young Mary Keane-Dawson, who made it to be an MD by 27 and went on to buy and sell several agencies, plus reconstruct a few more — well done. Congratulations. I'm very glad you stuck with it and never compromised yourself or your beliefs. Today you're surrounded by a wonderful family and fantastic friends, many of whom are former colleagues and clients. And you've helped pave the way for more female leaders.
Not a bad run at it, when all is said and done.",2023-05-02T11:10:29.195Z,no,2023-05-02,"post date: 2023-05-02 Thank you Mary Keane-Dawson for your Advice To My Younger Self.

Ogilvy UK, DAVID Madrid and DAVID São Paulo have won a Grand Prix together at Cannes. Our Dove #TurnYourBack campaign has won a Grand Prix and a Gold in Media, and a Bronze in Social and Influencer, at Cannes Lions. What a night. 

Congratulations to each and everyone involved, especially to the powerhouse  Daniel Fisher, Lindsey Gonnella and Jo Bacon who lead from the front, our influencer and creative legends, including Rahul Titus, David Anderson and ian brassett, and of course DAVID Madrid and DAVID São Paulo, who we did it with.

Daniel Fisher, Global Executive Creative Director, Ogilvy:
“Watching how we all came together as a global network to turn this around in a matter of days, from brief to going live, gave me goosebumps. It brought back memories of ‘Courage is Beautiful, and I’m sure this will have just as much impact. #turnyourback was a truly integrated campaign in every sense, developed within hours by Ogilvy UK and DAVID Madrid, with production assistance from DAVID São Paulo. From the outset we leveraged earned, social, influence and creativity, all working in perfect harmony to maximum effect.

""The Future in Germany is Migrant"" was the powerful slogan of the event that was divided into three parts: A panel discussion, engaging workshops, and networking with startups.  

I want to express my gratitude to Ana Álvarez - Founder and CEO of Migrapreneur ® for inviting me to participate in the panel discussion. It was an honor to share my journey and discuss the challenges I've faced as a migrant in Germany. Being part of such a meaningful conversation was a privilege.
I am deeply thankful to Migrapreneur for awarding me two scholarships through Coursera last year, specifically in UX Design and Digital Marketing and E-commerce. These opportunities not only enriched my skill set but also opened up new possibilities in my professional path. Being part of the Migrapreneur community has truly been a game-changer.

During the workshop sessions, I had the opportunity to attend Pedro Duarte's workshop, where he shared valuable insights into creating the podcast ""La Vida de Nosotros"" in Germany. The session was interesting and inspiring, offering a unique perspective on storytelling in a new cultural context.

Lastly, during the networking time, it was a pleasure connecting and exchanging experiences with mentors and experts like Arun M., Julieta Alvarez, and Manuel Sánchez .

Microsoft está llevando su tecnología publicitaria al siguiente nivel con las últimas actualizaciones de Copilot AI, un avance significativo en la personalización de anuncios y la creación de experiencias publicitarias interactivas. Estas nuevas funciones permiten a las marcas no solo optimizar sus campañas, sino también crear contenido más relevante y ajustado a las preferencias individuales de cada usuario.

Gracias a la integración de inteligencia artificial más avanzada, los anunciantes ahora tienen la capacidad de generar experiencias que capturan la atención y generan mejores resultados en todas las plataformas digitales. Copilot AI facilita el diseño de anuncios más inteligentes y efectivos, al tiempo que ofrece una mayor flexibilidad en la ejecución de estrategias publicitarias.

Principales beneficios:
Personalización a gran escala: Las marcas pueden ajustar sus anuncios en tiempo real según las interacciones del usuario, maximizando la relevancia.
Optimización continua: La IA aprende y adapta los anuncios automáticamente, mejorando el rendimiento sin intervención manual.
Interactividad mejorada: Los usuarios pueden participar en experiencias más dinámicas, lo que incrementa el engagement y las conversiones.
Con estas mejoras, Microsoft reafirma su compromiso con la transformación digital de la publicidad, ofreciendo herramientas potentes que facilitan la conexión con las audiencias y permiten a los anunciantes destacar en un mercado cada vez más competitivo.

¿Su marca está preparada para aprovechar al máximo la inteligencia artificial en la publicidad? El futuro de la publicidad digital ya está aquí, y Copilot AI es una pieza clave de esta evolución.

7084916245170450433,"For promotions nerds like me, Amazon Prime Day is pretty exciting.

Here are a couple of takeaways so far: 

🎯 Lots of personalization attempts (and I’ve read mostly good reviews of their personalization progress this year), but mine are still wildly off the mark. My top recommendations today? A carseat, and a pair of women's beach shoes. I am a childless, carless man in a landlocked city. ""WOW Offers"" indeed 😂 Anyone else?

✉️ The invitation-only offers are quite clever. Here's the deal: you have to express intent to even be ""invited"" to get an offer. It seems to just be a superficial thing (I got invited to all the deals I tried), but I love the idea that a user has to actually say ""Yeah, I want this offer!"" to get the deal. This builds a brilliant sense of exclusivity / scarcity for the offers. VERY smart.

🥴 Search & navigation on this site just get worse & worse. I scroll past a ton of junk to find the ""Kitchen"" offers, click ""Kitchen,"" then have to scroll past 6 rows of vacuum cleaners...

So in short, some smart new promotions tactics, but mostly more examples of Amazon's ensh*ttification & ""Day 2"" culture. Quite a different business from the Amazon of the past, with pretty run-of-the-mill prices and fulfillment and soooo much junk!

I can't stop thinking about how Victor Castro described Amazon on Rick Watson's podcast this week from a brand perspective: 

“It’s an overcrowded, really busy shopping mall with a ton of traffic. But I’m really not interested in paying rent at this mall. I am happy to stand at the door with a flier about my product, but don't want to pay rent for a store.""

Overall, clicking around the Prime Day offers has built my optimism that retailers have a fighting chance to claw more and more revenue back from Amazon. I really think these issues (bad experience, bad quality) are foundational and have totally eclipsed the company’s once legendary customer centricity & ability to innovate.

Would love to hear your notes on Prime Day. Just after I get back from driving my non-existent child in my non-existent car for a swim at our non-existent local beach.

I was amazed by the presence of numerous retailers at the conference, such as OBI Group Holding, OTTO, and Lidl in Germany. It felt more like a retail event than a marketing and tech-focused conference. Of course, there were also many exhibitors showcasing the #eCommerce industry! 🛍️

In the startup valley, I noticed several services dedicated to eCommerce, including analytics, ad campaign optimization, A/B testing, creative work, post-view and post-click optimization, conversions, and attributions. This was a significant highlight compared to previous years.

I want to emphasize the industry's growing trend of retail and AI. One of the talks that stood out to me was by Birk Angermann from Shopify. The ""Imagine the AI-Powered Future of Commerce"" was genuinely captivating. It delved into how cutting-edge technology could shape the future of most businesses.

The conference attracted many attendees, giving it a genuinely European vibe. It was great to see business partners and people I know personally there. While I had the opportunity to attend some fantastic speakers and live meetings on the first day, the second day was dedicated to networking and connecting with my business partners 🤝

The only downside was that some talks were conducted in German without English translation, making it challenging to understand the content. However, overall, it was an amazing conference, and I'm already looking forward to attending next year! 🎉

7245744782151438336,"The Armenia Digital Awards 2024 by ECDMA  and Digital & Ecomm EVN Conference are now behind us. It's a mix of emotions – happiness for what we achieved, but also a bit of sadness that it’s almost over. What's left is preparing press releases, delivering awards to those who couldn't attend, analyzing our mistakes, and figuring out the future of these events.

Some people have asked, ""How much did you earn?"" If we’re talking money, the answer is simple – I earned a significant amount, just with a minus sign in front of it (or as some like to call it, ""substantial negative growth"") 😄. But I see it as an investment. An investment in the development of Armenia's market and community.

Thanks to these events, I got to meet so many incredible people – people who are great to talk to about life and work, people who are ready to help without expecting anything in return, even offering their support before being asked. These are people with whom I’m sure we’ll create many more projects together.

The conference, which Artak Harutyunyan  (so glad we met and became partners) and I organized from scratch in just a two weeks, saw an incredible turnout. I’ve never seen a conference in Yerevan where, 40 minutes before the start, the hall was already half full. At one point, we had around 200 attendees simultaneously, and considering the flow of people coming and going, there were over 280 participants in total. These are incredible numbers!

The speakers were highly professional, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the audience was actively engaging, not just scrolling on their phones.

Yes, there were some surprising challenges along the way – the low engagement from agencies (globally, agencies are typically the main participants, submitting their client work), the hesitation from sponsors, the lack of interest from ministries, and the reluctance of voters to leave written feedback on government services (even though they have plenty to say in person). But these are minor setbacks – we'll make it even better next time.

These were my first events where I was the lead organizer. Sure, I’ve often spoken at conferences and been involved in the setup in my corporate life, but this was different. The adrenaline is something I already crave more of, and I completely understand people in the event industry – always exhausted, but never giving up.

Thank you to everyone who helped, participated, and attended. Thank you to the jury, the press, new and old friends, and my family.

I’ll write a few more thoughtful posts later, but for now, it’s all emotions – apologies for the long read.

I personally take it very serious thinking about dinamics, questions and topics to raise so the conference and audience enjoy/learn during my speaking slot. Furthermore, if you need to combine this with projects/daily tasks it even gets more challenging ㊙ . Nevertheless, it's time and effort well invested and eventually is all about connections and networking.

Many thanks a lot for all the organisors for trusting my experience and knowledge to moderate/speak/debate about these topics on these conferences.

While our team is attending the INBOUND event in Boston, I took a wee break to enjoy the Italian Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Temple of Speed.

Attending reminded me not only how much I love F1 but also of all the business lessons one can learn from this sport.

F1 is a prime example of:
🤝 Great teamwork - the driver and the team need to trust each other, communicate openly, and work together seamlessly
🧩 The importance of strategy - you can have the fastest car in the world but a wrong strategic decision can get you off the podium (cough Ferrari cough)
🌊 Adaptability - teams have to embrace change as anything from the weather to accidental contact can affect their performance
🔄 Continuous optimisation - by collecting and analysing their data the teams are able to improve their performance, even in real-time
🏆 Having a winning attitude - even when things go wrong, it’s important to focus on the goal, take the learnings, and go to the next race ready to fight back

F1 is so much more than just fast cars, so if you get a chance to watch a race, give it a go!

Are you already an F1 fan? Let me know in the comments!

7123652008330342400,"🚀 Yesterday, history was made in Frankfurt with the phenomenal ""Hello Shopware"" event – the first of its kind in Germany.

💡 The concept was something new in the Shopware ecosystem: An event that looks before, under, over, and beyond Shopware, with the customer at the core of everything. The feedback speaks for itself – we witnessed a tremendous quality of presentations and panels.

Some highlights:

🛍️ Michael Sahlender from Mirakl took the stage, enlightening us on how a Shopware merchant can transition their shop and entire business into a platform/marketplace.

📈 Another standout moment was the panel with Stefan Beyler from MEGABAD GmbH and Stefan Hamann from shopware AG. They delved into midmarket challenges and best practices, offering invaluable perspectives.

🏅 Erik Reintjes from MissPompadour GmbH captivated the audience by demonstrating the successful implementation of a highly effective loyalty program.

🤖 But the absolute highlight? The AI Panel with Stefan Hamann, Peter Buxmann, and Yann Karl. Their insights were nothing short of transformative.

🌙 Even after a long and tough day, the networking session was a pure success, lasting well into the night.

🎥 For those who missed it, don't worry! All sessions were recorded and will be available soon.

🙏 A huge thanks to all our partners and attendees. This is just the beginning. We've set the bar high, and it's only going to get better from here.

Modex brought together a melting pot of supply chain professionals, technologists, and innovators from across the globe, offering a rare glimpse into the diverse solutions and products shaping our industry. Here are some personal key takeaways that really stood out to me:

**Global Solutions to Local Problems: Many of the challenges we face locally have already been addressed by the West, offering relatable case studies and insights that are directly applicable to our work.

**Beyond Innovation: The adoption of cutting-edge warehouse automation technologies like ASRS, AMRs, and AGVs isn't just about an innovative mindset. Factors like labor and storage costs, along with labor shortages, are pushing the industry towards these solutions at an accelerated pace.

**Software Reigns Supreme: The backbone of successful hardware turnkey projects is highly flexible, reliable, and scalable software technology. It's clear that in the realm of supply chain solutions, software still wears the crown.

 **Top-tier Talks: The quality of the presentations at Modex was unparalleled. It was a privilege to hear from professionals who have not only devised but also implemented groundbreaking solutions, offering clear and insightful articulations of their work.

 **AI’s Untapped Potential: The exploration of AI in supply chain management is still in its infancy, presenting a vast field of opportunity for innovation and application.

**A Call to Action for SMEs: The current landscape of supply chain technology often overlooks SMEs due to cost barriers, highlighting a significant opportunity for India to develop cost-effective solutions tailored to their needs.

Attending Modex 2024 was an insightful journey that has broadened my perspective and fueled my excitement for the future of supply chain innovation. The convergence of diverse ideas and solutions at this event was truly inspiring, underscoring the dynamic nature of our industry. Can't wait to see how we can apply these learnings to make a tangible impact!

7069583291946852352,"What actually is Partner Management? - Part 7

After a short break the last weeks as of time-intensive offline events and vacation on my end, I am happy to continue this series about #partnermanagement.

Partner management is in general at the front row within the industry it is operating for several reasons. Researching the #industry and #market is necessary to develop the right understanding of the various players and #stakeholders the organization is surrounded by.
Searching for potential new #partnerhips and developing #relationships is one crucial functionality of partner management.
Whether these partnerships are #strategic, #service, or #sales partnerships is of secondary importance for the time being. The underlying function here is in each case #businessdevelopment. 
Once the relationship with the #partner is established, the focus is often on #leadgeneration. Again, this is a form of business development. 
Does this mean that partner management is business development? 
Business development lies at the heart of effective partner management. Without business development, partnerships can't be developed or used to their full potential. Partner management is, therefore, an important part of the organization's general business development and contributes to its general #success.

Recently I have received a lot of positive feedback on this post series. I am glad to know that my posts are actually read and help partner management #colleagues.

#powerofpartnership #nearbound ",,2023-05-31T08:00:03.294Z,no,2023-05-31,"post date: 2023-05-31 What actually is Partner Management? - Part 7

After a short break the last weeks as of time-intensive offline events and vacation on my end, I am happy to continue this series about #partnermanagement.

Partner management is in general at the front row within the industry it is operating for several reasons. Researching the #industry and #market is necessary to develop the right understanding of the various players and #stakeholders the organization is surrounded by.
Searching for potential new #partnerhips and developing #relationships is one crucial functionality of partner management.
Whether these partnerships are #strategic, #service, or #sales partnerships is of secondary importance for the time being. The underlying function here is in each case #businessdevelopment. 
Once the relationship with the #partner is established, the focus is often on #leadgeneration. Again, this is a form of business development. 
Does this mean that partner management is business development? 
Business development lies at the heart of effective partner management. Without business development, partnerships can't be developed or used to their full potential. Partner management is, therefore, an important part of the organization's general business development and contributes to its general #success.

Recently I have received a lot of positive feedback on this post series. I am glad to know that my posts are actually read and help partner management #colleagues.

One such brand is Mercedes-Benz AG-Benz that recently teamed up with Merkley + Partners to try out a cookieless targeting solution called SORT from Perion-owned Undertone.

The plan was to compare the results against both cookie-based targeting and contextual targeting.

Apple’s decision to eliminate IDFA with the launch of iOS 14 forced the industry to do some serious soul searching and naturally led to a scramble for new solutions. 

But, it certainly didn’t mean the end of effective advertising on mobile. Yet advertisers and tech companies had to rethink what it means to provide relevant ads to users and how they do it.

7168118083570524160,"Quando chiedono ai miei parenti “che lavoro fa Marco?” Loro solitamente rispondono “vende telefoni”.
Ci abbiamo sempre riso sopra quando ci siamo ritrovati a parlarne, perché effettivamente è una parte del mio lavoro ma odio questa definizione… è terribilmente incompleta. 

In un mercato così saturo di system integrator, provider di ogni genere, rivenditori dell’ultima ora e sedicenti professionisti dai Job Title improbabili, non è semplice spiegare in maniera rapida e concreta il mio lavoro a chi non conosce me e l’azienda per cui lavoro. 

Mi sono impegnato quindi in questo esercizio: mettere per iscritto “cosa fa” MMN - Magnetic Media Network S.p.A. Con l’obiettivo di essere sintetico e chiaro (e perchè no, di tirar fuori un “testo tipo” per fare un po’ di hunting di nuovi clienti🥳)

Ed eccoci qua…
COS’È MMN?
È un Solutions Provider in ambito IT da 35 anni.

COS’È UN SOLUTION PROVIDER?
Solutions: SOLUZIONI
Provider: FORNITORE

CHE TIPO DI SOLUZIONI? QUAL’È IL PERIMETRO IN CUI OPERA?
Attraverso un approccio basato sui propri valori (Onestà, Positività, Umanità e Passione) MMN agisce su quattro “pillars”:

- Deployment & Employee Chioce:  forniamo ed integriamo il miglior hardware disponibile sul mercato e offriamo soluzioni EMM/MDM che permettono la distribuzione su larga scala, il setup e la messa in sicurezza dei dispositivi in modo automatizzato.

Ci abbiamo sempre riso sopra quando ci siamo ritrovati a parlarne, perché effettivamente è una parte del mio lavoro ma odio questa definizione… è terribilmente incompleta. 

In un mercato così saturo di system integrator, provider di ogni genere, rivenditori dell’ultima ora e sedicenti professionisti dai Job Title improbabili, non è semplice spiegare in maniera rapida e concreta il mio lavoro a chi non conosce me e l’azienda per cui lavoro. 

Mi sono impegnato quindi in questo esercizio: mettere per iscritto “cosa fa” MMN - Magnetic Media Network S.p.A. Con l’obiettivo di essere sintetico e chiaro (e perchè no, di tirar fuori un “testo tipo” per fare un po’ di hunting di nuovi clienti🥳)

Ed eccoci qua…
COS’È MMN?
È un Solutions Provider in ambito IT da 35 anni.

COS’È UN SOLUTION PROVIDER?
Solutions: SOLUZIONI
Provider: FORNITORE

CHE TIPO DI SOLUZIONI? QUAL’È IL PERIMETRO IN CUI OPERA?
Attraverso un approccio basato sui propri valori (Onestà, Positività, Umanità e Passione) MMN agisce su quattro “pillars”:

- Deployment & Employee Chioce:  forniamo ed integriamo il miglior hardware disponibile sul mercato e offriamo soluzioni EMM/MDM che permettono la distribuzione su larga scala, il setup e la messa in sicurezza dei dispositivi in modo automatizzato. Mettiamo l’IT, il finance e l’HR dei nostri clienti nelle condizioni di permettere ai dipendenti di scegliere la piattaforma preferita con cui lavorare.

-Spatial Computing: sviluppiamo ecosistemi di app (per Apple Vison Pro e non solo) per introdurre nelle aziende questo nuovo paradigma.

-Digital transformation: sviluppiamo app custom per digitalizzare i processi (turnazioni, documentali, check-list coprorate).

6992794856808984576,"A data first marketer client of ours asked me how he can get started with coding, this is the roadmap i gave him today 
 
He believes that marketing + coding = unstoppable combination and for his kind of asks and therefore i feel understanding and manipulating data will be critical for him.  
 
- Learn Python for both writing short scripts that can read and write from a file.  
- Learn Pandas and Matplotlib or Seaborn to understand and manipulate data and build visualizations. 
- Learning fundamentals of REST API's.  
- Store data using MongoDB  
- JSON format is the preferred format for data interchange.  
 
What else do you think i should ask him to build up on without going through the kind of grind a software engineering candidate will need to go through.

7247153461534814208,"🚀 Two weeks since I visited DMEXCO 2024 in Cologne, and it was quite an eye-opener. 🌍 While it's still regarded as Europe's biggest digital marketing event, this year's experience left me with a mix of insights and organizational challenges to reflect on.

From the noticeable absence of major social media players to some organizational hurdles on the ground, I’m left wondering - has DMEXCO started losing its edge? 🤔 Still, there were valuable takeaways around B2B marketing, AI innovations, and the power of personalization for boosting sales.

6853788049009106946,"This little girl is me
🌏When I was little, growing up in a small town, I was told that the farthest place I could travel was Russia. So I joined a Russian club to get myself ready. After the wall came down, I learned more languages (English, Spanish, French) and have traveled 66 countries by now including Russia.

🎤As a teenager, I was told that I might not get to study despite my A grades because of my family's non-conformist views in communist East Germany. In 1988, my application to study international business was rejected, another reason why I took part in the peaceful revolution in 1989 joining my pharmacist dad speaking in front of thousands about environmental pollution in the GDR.

In 1990, I was among the first generation of students that joined a Western German university even before Germany was officially reunited. Later I used my business sense to work at world class international companies like Procter & Gamble, Merck, Google, Stada. Like my dad, I go on stages to speak up and ignite transformation. I am happy to support Yunus Social Business and Generation CEO to drive more of that for business and our society.

Why am I sharing this? Because there might be a little or not so little girl out there who is wondering which borders she can cross.
Because 70% of girls feel more confident about their future
after hearing from female role models.
