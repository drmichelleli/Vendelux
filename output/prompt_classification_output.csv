This year was somehow different. Last year I ran over 1.500 km and this year I wasn’t even able to manage half of it. I tried everything from sports therapy, electro shocks, cortisone, pain killers etc. Nothing fixed the hip problem.

And me without sports is like running a Tesla without a battery. So I will go back to the traditional way of simply pushing my limits, going far, further and beyond. And to turn on the heat I will aim to finish my first half Ironman in August. 

I am super happy and grateful to have a loving family, good friends and awesome colleagues supporting me on all my journeys.

Hopefully we will all see each other more often next year. Cytric by Amadeus will make it happen! Stay safe and healthy and have a fantastic start in 2022.

Bring it on.

Last week Cologne became the hub for digital trends by hosting #DMEXCO and #DIGITALX and I was part of it.

The focus of the Dmexco was AI and how society can embrace it, also by sharing data (it will become our ""new normal"").

Digital X on the other hand, pointed out 3 trends security, future of work and sustainability. 

My honest feedback: I would definetly try my best to be part of it again in 2025. It`s about the people I met, the conversations I had and definetly the masterclasses I visited. 

The fact that I mixed some meetings with great people (thank you again for taking the time!) and also having some free which lead to meeting super interesting new people (I definetly want to catch up soon) was the best way to enjoy those three days in Cologne.

Thank you Kölle!

7064950983834918912,"The reason for this question is because there is no real feedback loop - programmatically or otherwise - showing publishers where they are succeeding or failing. 

The only publisher side metric is spend (impressions x CPM) and thats too broad an optic to draw actionable conclusions. 

This is a big problem for many publishers and publisher networks like us.

Its something DSP's should solve for, because it will make many publishers work harder for you and the media you buy perform better.

#programmatic ","I often get the following question in a variety of flavors, “How do I (Publisher) get more advertiser spend through Trade Desk?” 💰💰

The truth is, there is no magical button combination the inventory team has access to. The real driver of advertiser spend is…… directly tied to advertiser value. 🧐

Sounds simple right? Yet, the truth is advertiser’s budgets follow partnerships that prioritize value. 😮

You may be thinking, what does advertise value mean? That’s the better question. ❓🙋🏽♂️

When chatting with most brands and agencies, the definition of value would include some form of the following ingredients…

1️⃣ The ability to use their first party data to determine which impressions to buy. 

2️⃣ The ability to understand how their ad dollars drove business outcomes. 

3️⃣ The ability to take insights learned and apply them to future planning and marketing strategies. 

4️⃣ The ability to maximize efficiency by measuring reach and frequency effectively. 

By helping marketer’s maximize efficiency and effectiveness, you drive value. When you drive value, you increase your share of advertisers budgets. 

In summary, maximize value.

7242485360394473473,"5 years ago, I joined the media industry as an apprentice.

In this time, my love for advertising has only grown, this is an incredible industry, where some amazing work takes place.

But as well as the good within, I, like many others have come to the realisation that we’re at a tipping point, our industry can’t continue along its current path.

Seven in ten advertising campaigns generate a return on investment of less than £2 in revenue for every £1 spent, putting their profitability into question.

Billions of pounds in media spend is wasted every year, there are hundreds of separate reports which validate this.

The vast majority of advertising is disliked by consumers.

Quality publishers are struggling to survive.

The business model is struggling with clients on agency merry-go-rounds and staff underpaid and overworked.

I attended the Who Cares Event put on by Brian Jacobs & Nick Manning last week.

It was inspiring to hear from some of the industry greats on how we can change this industry for the better.

This wasn’t a session to bash the current state of play, it was on how we can look forward.

The reality is, that the principles of advertising are the same today as they were 100 years ago, a great advert will always be great.

Let’s face it, advertising is far too often over-complicated and as a result, it regularly gets a bad rep.

But guess what?

It matters.

We all know how important advertising can be not just in driving sales, but also in culture.

It’s about the emotions it stirs. The way it moves people. The messages it sends.

But we need to be better at telling this story with harder numbers and stronger words.

One that goes beyond reach, clicks, and other vanity metrics.

The business model is changing, and with this, we need to start recognising the true value of great advertising.

It's not about pumping out ads and campaigns.

It's about identifying growth opportunities, designing solutions, and using tech and creativity to make them happen faster.

I’m sure there will be a lot more to follow from last week’s session.

But one thing is certain, it’s crucial that as a collective we have more conversations on how we can improve the advertising and media industry for the better.

And ultimately, caring is the first step to change.",,2024-09-19T10:51:08.755Z,no,no,"The post date is September 19, 2024, which is one day after the event date of DMEXCO 2024. Therefore, the post is not related to the event."

The volume of US visitors shows the importance of these events in the calendar and I am so appreciative of those who come over the pond, invest their time to fully understand our #Sportradar business, grow our partnerships, explore new initiatives and create bespoke solutions that keep as the clear market leader in what we do.

So many meetings, and too many to name here but huge special thanks to Criteo, IPONWEB (acquired by Criteo), Sovrn, Index Exchange, Sharethrough, LG Ad Solutions, Broadsign, TVM, for fuelling some great ideas.

You may be wondering how we prepared great speech and what we learned in 53 hours.  I'll tell you anyway.

 3 components:
  - Engagement, eye contact, communication with the audience.  Ask the audience to clap or raise their hands. 
  - Tell stories.  We love storytelling and miss the point if there are no ones.  The story should be vivid and relevant for thetarget audience. Let me tell you how to grow a bonsai (small tree) with your own hands?  I read a whole book at the age of 13 on the topic.  Such a story does not fall into your interests.

7028617280137650176,"As Simon Sinek states: ""There is a difference between giving direction and giving directionS.“

And the difference that matters isn't the extra “s”. For me, the difference lies in providing employees with supportive guidance to help them grow and develop, professionally and personally.

This is one of the important aspects of our Employer Value Proposition at HRS Group, which I was happy to share as a panelist at the refreshing ""LinkedIn Local"" event with Katharina Lages-Willner, Markus Ollig, Felix Wesseler hosted by Britta Behrens 💡. 

Why is a distinct Employer Value Proposition so essential for attracting and retaining the best-suited talent for your company, even more so today?

Because the pandemic not only changed how we work, but why we work! This newly revitalized YOLO (you only live once) mentality manifests itself in the workplace through the search for meaning and happiness. Consequently, businesses need to adapt.

How?
The crucial step before any sort of “Branding"" is defining a meaningful Employer Value Proposition. This includes carving out core values that are deeply ingrained into the culture and therefore have differentiation power.

At HRS, we work on this cluster of values or shared behaviors. We call them “Leading Principles”. These 9 principles are made to guide quality decision-making on a daily basis, people development and promotion as well as the recruitment of new talents - and they are made for everyone, regardless of position or level. 

In that regard, I am convinced that my HRS colleagues and alumni at the local event would confirm that titles or hierarchies have no bearing at HRS. We prioritize a culture of merit where collective thinking is favored and good ideas are implemented regardless of who brought them to the table.

In my opinion, companies are able to attract and retain capable talent - despite the shortage of skilled workers. It depends on the leadership's strategic reflection and determination to work on a compelling Employer Value Proposition as well as our collective capacity (or better said, grit) to learn and work with the future.

7042220197381861376,"ASSESSING THE MATURITY LEVEL OF AN ORGANIZATION’S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY WHEN HIRING THE RIGHT EXECUTIVE
Organizations will benefit greatly from knowing the maturity level of their digital transformation at the time of hiring any top-level executive; the success of digital transformation initiatives often depends on the leadership of the organization. A high level of digital transformation maturity implies that the organization has already embarked on the digital transformation journey and has made significant progress in implementing digital technologies and processes to improve its operations, enhance customer experience, and stay competitive.
By hiring a top-level executive with experience and expertise in driving digital transformation in highly mature organizations, the organization can leverage their knowledge, skills, and best practices to accelerate its own digital transformation journey. Such executives can help the organization further develop and execute a clear digital strategy, identify and prioritize digital initiatives, build a culture of innovation, and drive organizational change.
On the other hand, if an organization is at a lower level of digital transformation maturity, it may need an executive who has experience in driving digital transformation from the ground up, and who can help build the foundation for digital transformation by establishing the necessary infrastructure, processes,
and culture. 
At CONSULTREE we have developed the DTI – Digital Transformation Index assessment to help organizations quickly learn the maturity level before engaging in an executive search process.  The 15-minute assessment is applied to both: the Executive Team pre-search and to the short-listed candidates pre-hire.
In summary, assessing the maturity level of a company's digital transformation is essential for hiring the right executive. It helps to identify gaps, set realistic expectations, plan strategically, mitigate risks, and ensure a positive ROI. Without this assessment, a company may hire the wrong executive who is ill-equipped to support or lead the digital transformation efforts. Moreover, the DTI assessment helps ensure that the organization hires an executive with the right skills, experience, and mindset to help drive the organization's digital transformation journey successfully.

7039142279579594753,"Recently at a client lunch, I was asked by a female MD what advice I would give to my younger self.

This photo shows a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed girl brimming with enthusiasm in her first graduate job as a data analyst. 

I was a whirlwind and broke almost every workplace rule in my first few weeks. 

Dancing on the table at my first client party, watched soberly by my MD and senior colleagues, was not a career-propelling moment. 

It’s been quite a journey from those (wild) days to my current role at GingerMay.

So how would I advise new joiners to progress in their career? 

They need to FAIL. That is, to have a First Attempt In Learning and the growth mindset that accompanies it. 

It’s not the failure that’s the problem, it’s the way you tackle the failure. Will you lick your wounds and vow never to try again? 

Or will you get back up, assess the damage, and try again a different way? 

The feedback is often excruciating and it hits your ego where it hurts most - but it’s also true that where there’s discomfort, there’s the opportunity to make the most change and gains.

And just for the record, I’ll never mark anyone down for dancing on tables at a client party.

Thanks Zuzanna Gierlinska for the initial idea.

And Toni Thompson, my senior director dance partner-in-crime.

Just wrapped up an incredible experience at DMEXCO 2024, and I’m more inspired than ever! This year’s theme, ""Prompting the Future,"" couldn’t be more fitting. From the masterclasses to the keynote speeches, every moment was a powerful reminder of how far AI has come in just one year.

The energy and innovation at this year’s conference were palpable, and the discussions around AI are no longer about what’s possible—they’re about what’s *already* happening. I was blown away by how quickly AI is reshaping industries, unlocking new creative potentials, and driving business strategies forward. 🚀

One of my personal highlights was the keynote with DeepL and a marketing mastermind who shared insights from his experience working with Berghain. It was amazing to be surrounded by so many inspiring, motivated, and committed disciples of the AI discipline. A major takeaway: ""Reach is Religion"" is the new ""Content is King."" We’re in a new era, and it's thrilling to witness the shift!

What struck me most was how AI isn't replacing us—it's enhancing our abilities. We’re not just using AI; we’re learning to *work with it*, expanding our skills and reaching new heights of innovation. The future is bright, and I’m excited for what's next as we continue to explore how humans and AI can build a world full of possibilities, together. 🤖✨

The year is ~2013, my co-founders Nils, Lucas, and me had just closed our first hand-full of clients with our first company, hired our first employee and were ready for our first ""big"" event. Much like everything we did back then, we had exactly zero clue (in this case, how events worked). 

So... 

1️⃣ We picked an absurdly off-target event (the NUFAM Karlsruhe, a trade show for commercial utility vehicles 😂 - we were SaaS for project management even back then)
2️⃣ We totally misjudged what it takes to create a working booth (I mean... look at the place 🙈)
3️⃣ We had exactly no pre-campaign at all, so our booth was empty about 80% of the time

The whole situation was so embarrassing (and such a waste of time), that we left after day 1 of a 4 day event, gave the booth to our neighbours (Piaggio Group, they parked a car on it 💁♂️) and wrote the whole thing off. Total disaster.

Came across this little gem of a photo while our team around Ayla, Julia, Julian, Philipp & Co. were organising this year's wonderful DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference for us (and stressing out about it) and I was wondering, why I was so feeling so relaxed... well, we've come a long way since that first booth, and I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have grown since then 👏 and of that (sometimes very awkward) journey.

Let me try to find a LinkedIn-worthy lesson in this 😉

Don't give up on things, just because they fail miserably on the first try, entrepreneurship really is a bit of a bumpy ride sometimes, everyone feels super stupid sometimes, be ready to give up on projects that obviously failed, don't take yourself too seriously, keep calm and carry on... ok, that's all I got.

7237765052173299712,"The 2024 AnyLogic conference is over and I spent 12+ hrs watching it 😆 Even late at night in Europe, I could not stop 🙃  Some observations:

1. Surprisingly advanced models. I have been at this conference for 10+ years and I feel like the overall community skill level is actually growing (or AnyLogic focusses on the advanced models, both would be good imo)

2. Surprises: even for a seasoned modeler, some presentations tried something quite rare or new. Such as ""AnyLogic inception"": build your model from a running experiment, or ChatGPT integrations

3. AnyLogic trying new formats: Lots of attendees really enjoyed the AnyLogic-9 workshop that was a role-playing exercise highlighting its features. Kudos to Andrei Borshchev for excellent acting. I think we need to combine our passion for it next time 😃 

4. Networking: Being an online conference, this was basically left to attendees. But it was a good reminder for me to reach out to colleagues and friends again. If you did not, follow my example and get some online coffee breaks into your diaries. For example with... me: https://lnkd.in/duYxaKbk  😊 

5. I am getting old: It was quite a weird feeling to see several presentations in which I was involved with indirectly. Some seeds I started at a clients years ago sprouting into big initiatives... Felt a bit like a gardener watching trees blossom...  🤗 

6. Lack of academia: All presentations were from real-world use-cases. I know academia and research is important, but I do prefer seeing lots of practical applications in my rare free time. (And WinterSim does offer more than enough space for Academia imo)

7. AnyLogic 8: great to see the team keeps on improving it massively, even polishing ""minor"" libraries like the road-traffic lib. Keep pushing

8. Omniverse: Lots of positive feedback during the demo. But more interestingly the discussions that are starting about it now. Fair bit of skepticism such as ""I don't see the value"", ""It is just management porn"" (not my words 😄 ). I think there are a ton of reasons beyond just looks (which is valuable in itself, mind you), will pick that up nearer to the release

Still, I hope next year's conference will be in-person or hybrid again. But even if not, the quality of talks never ceases to amaze me, thx to all presenters and the AnyLogic staff to make it happen 🙏

Was für ein intensiver Tag voller spannender Gespräche und inspirierender Vorträge! Neben einem Kaffee mit Sarah Fütterer und Julija Murawskij, einem kurzen Catch-up mit Hanna Berger und Fach-Deep-Talk mit Sandra Benger, habe ich einige wertvolle Takeaways von der DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference mitgenommen, die mich nicht nur in meiner Arbeit bestätigen, sondern auch neue Impulse setzen, um einige Strategien nochmal aus einer anderen Perspektive zu betrachten.

🔑 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:
Kreative Exzellenz in Zeiten von TikTok – Der Talk zwischen Paulina Schumann und Götz Ulmer war ein Highlight. Zwei kontroverse Ansätze, aber was mich besonders gefreut hat: Ich wurde in meinem Ansatz bestätigt, dass ""nicht jeder Klostein eine Community und Subkultur braucht"". Hand aufs Herz: Wie viele echte Brand Communities gibt es wirklich? 

Markenpower im Social Media-Zeitalter – Der Vortrag von Ann-Katrin Schmitz hat mich direkt gepackt. Besonders spannend fand ich den Aspekt aus der neuen Sprout Social Studie ""The 2024 Influencer Marketing Report"", dass die Wahrnehmung von Marken und die Kaufentscheidung zwischen Gen Z und uns Millennials stark differenziert. Für mich ein klarer Reminder, wie wichtig es ist, sich dezidiert mit der eigenen Zielgruppe auseinanderzusetzen.

Panel Talk: Sind Influencer Brands ""over""? – Danke an Hans Neubert für die spannenden Einblicke. Auch wenn es keine Überraschung ist, dass circa 2% der Influencer in den nächsten Jahren ihre eigene Brand auf den Markt bringen, war es ein Aha-Moment, der noch einmal verdeutlicht, dass Influencer ihre langjährig aufgebauten Communities zu einem wirkungsvollen Asset machen.

Insgesamt eine großartige Erfahrung, viele neue Kontakte und wertvolle Einsichten – ich freue mich schon darauf, die neuen Impulse in die Tat umzusetzen!

Danke an das t3n Magazin Team für die Tickets.

As an investor, I couldn't think of a better hire than Ryan Boh (and also as a friend, but mostly/selfishly as an investor) to provide the necessary strategic direction and execution to unlock lockr's true potential.

","🚀 Thrilled to Share My New Adventure & Opportunity: Head of Identity at lockr🚀

A quick story before the big reveal...

Back in Spring 2021, I found myself presented with some fantastic job offers from diverse bunch of companies. Although I had only been at Oracle for a year, I was enjoying my time there and wasn't quite ready for a change. That's when Ryan McBride stepped in with a brilliant idea (shocking development): instead of moving on, he suggested I immerse myself in the startup world, collaborating with founders on innovative ideas, and introduced me to Keith Petri at lockr.

lockr's value proposition instantly resonated with me, and as I began using the platform and connecting Keith with bright minds in my network, my excitement grew. When the team unveiled their Identity lockr product a year ago, I was over the moon for two reasons: 

1) It marked the first time I'd seen a non-FAANG B2C product with the propensity to dramatically improve the online access experience for consumers, especially in an increasingly gated internet landscape. 

2) It took me back to a similar concept I pitched to Tim Petrycki in Fall 2019, which he loved but knew we wouldn't develop.

I firmly believe that solutions that bridge Consumer and Industry interests will significantly shape the future of addressability and regulatory compliance.

In the latter half of 2022, I began contemplating my next move at Oracle. While I loved the work, my colleagues, and the broad scope of my role, I yearned for a change I couldn't quite pinpoint. In December, a serious illness + parental leave provided me with ample time for reflection on my next challenge and life. By mid-January, it became clear that my Oracle chapter was coming to a close, and a month later, I regained my health. It was then that lockr resurfaced on my radar.

Today, I am both honored and ecstatic to announce that I have been appointed as the new Head of Identity at lockr! Additionally, I will continue to share my industry knowledge by continuing to teach digital marketing and marketing strategy as an Affiliate Professor at Anderson College of Business and Computing – Regis University
.
As I embark on this new chapter, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the incredible mentors, Oracle colleagues, and friends who have supported me and helped me identify the right path. You know who you are, and you're simply amazing!

💡 The concept was something new in the Shopware ecosystem: An event that looks before, under, over, and beyond Shopware, with the customer at the core of everything. The feedback speaks for itself – we witnessed a tremendous quality of presentations and panels.

Some highlights:

🛍️ Michael Sahlender from Mirakl took the stage, enlightening us on how a Shopware merchant can transition their shop and entire business into a platform/marketplace.

📈 Another standout moment was the panel with Stefan Beyler from MEGABAD GmbH and Stefan Hamann from shopware AG. They delved into midmarket challenges and best practices, offering invaluable perspectives.

🏅 Erik Reintjes from MissPompadour GmbH captivated the audience by demonstrating the successful implementation of a highly effective loyalty program.

🤖 But the absolute highlight? The AI Panel with Stefan Hamann, Peter Buxmann, and Yann Karl. Their insights were nothing short of transformative.

🌙 Even after a long and tough day, the networking session was a pure success, lasting well into the night.

🎥 For those who missed it, don't worry! All sessions were recorded and will be available soon.

This time is different, as we are not dealing with humans. 
On Saturday morning, terrorists from the Hamas penetrated into Israel, to people's houses, and butchered entire families. Babies, kids, women and elderly.
They went to a music festival and slaughtered everyone. I personally know a few people that either murdered or got kidnaped to Gaza. People that only want to dance, listen music and celebrate life got murdered by those animals.

Women-owned businesses are vital drivers of innovation, job creation, and economic growth, overcoming unique challenges to succeed in diverse industries. This month, we recognize the resilience, creativity, and leadership of these entrepreneurs who are breaking barriers and inspiring future generations. Let's use this opportunity to uplift and empower women-owned businesses by supporting their ventures, sharing their stories, and advocating for equal opportunities in the business world. 

Supporting women-owned small businesses during National Women's Small Business Month—and beyond—can have a meaningful impact. Here are several ways you can contribute:
-Shop from Women-Owned Businesses: Make a conscious effort to buy products and services from women entrepreneurs, whether locally or online.
-Spread the Word: Use your social media platforms to highlight and recommend women-owned businesses. Word of mouth is a powerful tool.
-Mentorship and Networking: Offer your expertise, time, or connections to women entrepreneurs looking for guidance or a broader network.
Invest in Women-Led Ventures: If you have the resources, consider investing in women-owned businesses through crowdfunding, angel investing, or business partnerships.
-Attend and Promote Events: Participate in or promote workshops, webinars, and events focused on women in business to raise awareness and foster community.
-Advocate for Policies: Support policies and initiatives that promote gender equality in entrepreneurship and business ownership. #smallbusiness #womenentrepreneurs #womenspresidentsorganization Women Presidents Organization",,2024-10-11T19:02:43.438Z,no,no,The post is not related to DMEXCO 2024.

- For the opening keynote, we had Christoph Weiss from Jung von Matt CREATORS on stage to talk about AI-driven marketing solutions and show some of their use cases.

- Next, we had three content streams where customers from across all four sister companies presented their use cases and shared best practices around #martech.

- Special thanks to Vulturu Anca from Lufthansa Group and Cyrill Quester from Miltenyi Biotec for sharing how MARMIND helps them increase transparency across the marketing organization. 🫶

- Last, but not least, DuMont Group CEO Christoph Bauer took to the stage to share his vision for United Marketing Technologies for the years ahead.

- Our Co-CEO Patrick Moser and censhare’s Chris Leaman presented a masterclass on why integration is key when it comes to building a solid martech stack.

All in all, three days packed with customer insights, great conversations, and lots of coffee. And, most importantly, a team dinner with our sister companies censhare, ELAINE technologies (ehemals artegic), Facelift. 🥰

Here’s what’s on the agenda:
✅ How cybercriminals use IP addresses to sneak into places they shouldn’t—like that one friend who shows up at the party uninvited and eats all the snacks.
✅ Why residential proxies are like the fake moustaches of the internet—hiding people’s real identities but, spoiler alert, we can still see you!
✅ And why, no matter how many firewalls you have, your “password123” isn’t fooling anyone (except maybe you). 🧑💻

I’ll be up there, trying to make phrases like “IP geolocation” and “multi-factor authentication” sound like the hottest topics of 2024. If you're around, come say hi! I’ll be the one casually slipping jokes about IP spoofing into an otherwise very serious conversation. 🎤✨

Wish me luck, and let’s hope I don’t accidentally block Dubai’s entire internet while I’m at it. 😂✈️

7250232546943188992,"[Video Recap of SparkTogether 2024] SparkTogether by SparkToro and Amanda Natividad is the best conference I’ve ever been to. Having won best speaker at the remote event last year and being invited to speak again this year, I intended to spit fire like a fully grown dragon and win the title again. 

However, I was quickly humbled when the other speakers ignited the stage.

They didn’t spit fire, they were fire. One by one like Phoenixes they bared their souls setting the room ablaze with wisdom and incredibly powerful stories.

We SparkedTogether!

Sarah Stockdale who inspired my talk and helped improve it got the only standing ovation. Her talk was nuclear and left the room with a radiant glow of inspiration. The ovation is in the video so watch it.

-SparkTogether is not an SEO conference but I learned some things about SEO
-It’s not a business conference but I learned a lot about business
-It’s not a Tony Robbin’s life coaching event, but I learned a lot about life, finding my purpose and got inspired.

-I learned that lots of agencies & business owners have suffered in the last few years and what they did to survive 
-I learned about the power of being vulnerable and asking for help. 
-I learned how to go viral and why it’s important that, that should not be your goal. 
-I learned how to publish a book and I got inspired by many of the attendees that I talked to who are incredible human beings.

SparkTogether is an experience.
We laughed, we cried, we learned.
We SparkedTogether.

As a speaker, finding a stage to be authentic and vulnerable is hard. It’s almost impossible at normal conferences. 

SparkTogether is different because it is built for that.

I shared the stage with the best of the best:

 Rand Fishkin, Geraldine DeRuiter, Ann Handley, Sarah Stockdale, Eli Goodman, Britney Muller, Michael King, and Anne-Laure Le Cunff.

When I left it exhausted and depleted because I relived life and death traumas, trying to show people how and why they should use their digital marketing skills for good. Geraldine stole my speaker badge and flashed me a cheeky smiley saying, “Looking for this?!” It’s the laugh I needed and made me realize why meeting people in real life at events like this is important. 😂 

Geraldine’s talk was incredible! If you go to any conference next year it has to be this one. Hopefully I’ll see you there and we can SparkTogether.

Thank you Rand, Amanda Natividad, Casey Henry and everyone I meet in person, for an incredible experience. 

Shout out to Kateri Kosta and her friend for sharing this amazing experience with me.

The highlight? Finally meeting my co-hosts Bryan, AJ and Wes in person, and hosting a PSVR GAMESCAST LIVE episode together in a hotel lobby, surrounded by our supporters who flew in for the occasion. Their support has been a backbone to my journey, and this offered a profound moment to express my gratitude in person.

Then, a surprise visit from BJ of Urban Wolf Games, jetting in from GDC in San Francisco to spend a few precious hours with us before flying back to South Korea, truly underscored the dedicated spirit of this community. Our enlightening discussions on nurturing the industry and advancing PSVR2, despite hurdles, were inspiring.

PAX East was more than gaming business. From savoring fantastic pizza, exploring retro games, attempting mech pilot training, to meeting awesome devs like Schell Games and Jackbox Games, attending insightful panels, and exchanging greetings with Pikachu, it was a comprehensive experience that revitalized my spirit.

This trip was a much needed reminder of why I do what I do and the impact it has. 

Heartfelt thanks to PAX East, the PSVR Without Parole family, and everyone I met. Your warmth and support have given me an extraordinary gift: a happier soul and a clearer vision for what comes next. 🙌 💙

🗯 In the World Café concept, you can divide a bigger team into smaller groups and define several topics to discuss about. Each topic has one host (and in an onsite setting normally a table with a whiteboard or similar). 

⏳ The groups move around from table to table with a specific time per slot (we chose 15 minutes). In each slot they discuss specific questions to that topic and leave their notes there - this way when the next group comes to that table, they can build on the thoughts of the previous group and so on. This way, you can engage the whole team on several topics in a short amount of time. And it's super dynamic! 🔥 

👩🎓 Recently, we used the World Café approach in a remote setting with multiple Zoom links and a shared Miro board to generate a shared understanding of our marketing OKR. By using different Zoom links and a shared Miro board, we created multiple ""tables"" or discussions around each marketing objective, allowing team members to contribute to different parts of the OKR set. 
This approach not only accommodated the limitations of remote work, but it also allowed team members to collaborate and share their ideas in a structured and inclusive way.

😅 Luckily, we had used the concept before in person for a mid-term OKR review, which made it easier to orchestrate the people and to spot possible failures. With our 30 people in marketing, we could form 5 groups and have a nice and easy group size. 

🤓 Overall, for the second run I was able to put some learnings into practice, although it was still not perfect. Find some learnings in the slides - happy to hear your thoughts, too! 

Using the World Café concept in a virtual setting can be a great way to foster collaboration, build a shared understanding, and create more engagement among team members. If you're looking for a creative way to define your marketing OKRs, give the World Café concept a try! What are your thoughts on defining OKR or similar strategic topics for bigger teams?

Yes, I’m a fucking fan boy of Hugging Face. These guys are my Backstreet Boys, my Nsync, my Take That. Man – I’m getting old. I’ve been working – rather successful I might add – in the tech industry for ages. Started to work as a CTO, Founder, CEO, hard core business developer, visionary, tech-enthusiast, graphic designer, marketer, programmer in my past. Passion and a solid understanding of Business, Technology, Design & Marketing accompanied my way. Building up successful companies, merging with others and always believing in the better. Also with a strong believe in the open-source movement, making #Pimcore the first open-source PIM/MDM in 2009 together with my dear founders Christian Fasching and Bernhard Rusch. Now used by over 110k companies on the globe, being a Gartner Customer Choice. What would happen, if we add some of that magic to Pimcore? Did I say “some”? Fuck no! Let’s make Pimcore the leading open-source AI/ML driven platform on the globe. With some assistance, knowledge and magic potion, by our friends at Hugging Face. That’s the plan.

Just a quick side note concerning being a fanboy: Dominik Matyka, Gian-Marco Spinosa, Randolf 💛 Jorberg, we have to get them to the DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference stage. The big one. Sir Martin Sorrell is great. Sure! But these guys give a true and valuable insight into the pure future of our economy and society. I would build up a 5 floor alpine hut (https://lnkd.in/dtPHS2V9) with my own hands to be able to show some open-source love at DMEXCO. I’d rather not being left back in regards to AI/ML topic in Germany. Even as I’m Austrian – living between the cows in the Alps. So, for example check-out laion ai, to see what’s going on in Hamburg. They’ve released the leading German-aware LLM based on Llama-2 a few days ago. Guess what? Open-Source, sure!

What’s in it for Pimcore you may ask. Right! And I’ve a bold answer for that. We wanna lead the pack, integrating AI/ML into the core of our beloved Pimcore. And I’m not only talking about natural language processing here, but also the wild stuff that is in front of us. Data modelling, ETL, smart assistants and some other craziness, I’ll share, when having a beer or two. Exactly this is on my mind and also on our AI/ML roadmap. And the Hugging Face Expert Acceleration Program will be a valuable source for inspiration and the passion to fulfill my dream. We are working on it and we will keep you guys updated.

Key topics at #dmexco were -not surprising-

💭 Generative AI
💭 ESG
💭 Post- Cookie Era
💭 Retail Media

While it was great meeting so many people at dmexco my actual highlight was -a bit unexpected I have to admit- the #DigitalX expo in the City with a great festival flair and many inspiring talks, panels and insights. 

A personal highlight was Amy Webb, who made some very valid remarks about:

➡️ The need to respond quickly to #change: she referred to the case of Nintendo, the Japanese company renowned for its video games. Despite being established in 1889 (!!), Nintendo stands out as an exemplary model of adapting to ever-evolving market demands.

➡️ The Status Quo of Germany - a rather poignant observation: The need for greater #audacity and #courage. The success of digitization hinges on companies (both corporates and SMEs) maintaining focus, making bold decisions, and adhering to them. 
This includes embracing #GenAI for substantial revenue growth. AI demands our serious consideration, as it will reshape how we work, learn, and engage with customers in the business realm, transcending mere hype. #Fear or #fomo?

And yes, of course, George Clooney and Björn Ulvaeus were also inspiring 😉

Over the last three days, alongside my super colleague Sebastian Matzner-Reska, I had the opportunity of attending tekom. It was a fantastic chance to reconnect with old friends and forge new connections in the technical writing community. 

Our discussions on hot topics such as

#mt-engine training
#quality prediction, 
#inclusive language
and #terminology tools 

were nothing short of enlightening.

And let's not forget the fun part! There was plenty of time for enjoying a cold beer, #networking, and sharing laughs in a very pleasant atmosphere.

And yes, thanks to #flixtrain 🚄 we got home safe 😆 

Adam Bittlingmayer I found the comparison between Laufrad and post-editing absolutely fascinating. Cheers to that!

Na DMEXCO 2024 o futuro do marketing digital está no centro das discussões. 
A jornada Data-Driven do Marketing e a importância de dados para campanhas mais personalizadas foram os highlights.

IA generativa na criação de conteúdos, direcionando o planejamento de campanhas, otimizações e entrega no target. IA como habilitadora de múltiplas possibilidades!

A privacidade de dados e as novas regulações seguem mudando e direcionando o jogo.

A responsabilidade social no uso das tecnologias e dados permearam ambos os congressos.

A reflexão é que as grandes transformações nos provocam com novas e grandes perguntas.

O agora e o futuro direcionados pela transformação digital contínua e o sucesso dos resultados virá da melhor combinação estratégica das tecnologias.💡

Tecnologia e Marketing atuando em conjunto para garantir o alinhamento dos investimentos em infra estrutura, estratégia de nuvem e de dados.

🕶️ Undercover Memories and a Look to the Future 🕶️

As I look at this picture, a warm wave of nostalgia and a pinch of that undercover agent 🕵♂️  thrill rushes back from DMEXCO'22.

At that juncture, I was on the cusp of embarking on a new adventure. Officially representing Gaubitz digital GmbH and just as a Interims Director for Growth Marketing at shopware AG, yet quietly stepping into a significant role at Shopware. Decked in Shopware attire, it felt a bit like being an undercover agent, because I can't give a sneak peek to my network to that time of the exciting transition that was about to unfold soon.

By my side are the remarkable Ann-Kathrin & Marius, our first-ever full-time pillars at Gaubitz digital. Witnessing their growth into formidable marketing professionals fills me with immense pride. Their presence added a layer of special to the undercover narrative, binding the past, the transitional present, and the promising future in one frame.

Now, the adventure continues, more vibrant and official than ever as I step into DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference, this time openly embracing my role as VP Marketing for Shopware. I am teeming with excitement to forge new pathways in E-Commerce, delving into how the best TCO for the mid-market and an extraordinary CX can harmoniously co-exist.

A key insight from these events is the critical role of establishing deeper, more meaningful connections with consumers. Retailers are increasingly investing in technologies, especially AI, to enhance personalization and improve competitive edge.🦾

Moreover, the concept of unified commerce emerged as a significant trend. This approach is crucial for retailers aiming to provide a consistent shopping experience across different platforms. 🛍️

💡 One thing that was abundantly clear from the conversations I had at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference was the excitement in the industry for what comes next.

What I learned...
👀 Marketing shift to quality – #Attention matters  
🤩  Not all attention is equal – User attention is different when they are intentionally engaged vs. doomscrolling 
👽 Authenticity can help brands resonate with their audience. 

My favourite session goes to GEEIQ by Charles Hambro and Megan Cheong, where they illustrated how #gaming can provide brands opportunities to reach people while they are gaming intentionally in an authentic way. 

Lastly kudos to The Women in Programmatic Network and Media For All [MEFA] for networking opportunities. Thoroughly enjoyed making new connections and learning from each other’s experiences.

Now back to the drawing board on how to make Overwolf and Nitro a place that both users and advertisers love.","Why are brands investing in gaming?


According to Charles Hambro, it’s all about attention. More specifically, it’s about the attention economy and how virtual worlds allow brands to connect with Gen Z in a more engaging way than traditional social media.

It’s been a great few days for the team at Advertising Week, with not one but two full houses for Charles as well as Megan Cheong.

If you’re there, make sure to reach out to Alex Holder, Conor McNamara, or Charles himself.

Otherwise, we’ll see you again next year!

Have a read in the link below!,"“At this year’s event, I got a real sense of a spirit of collaboration in many of the conversations I was party to. There was an eagerness to explore the exciting opportunities of direct partnerships between brands, agencies, and media owners, and those that come to fruition will move into new territory, stretching the limits of what’s possible.”

A week on from DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference, InfoSum’s VP Client Services, Ben Chivers, and other industry experts spoke to WARC about the key trends to emerge from the event.

As expected, AI and Google’s U-turn on cookies were a big focus. Despite this, marketers remain focused on moving the industry forward to a more privacy-centric and sustainable data-driven ecosystem.

7069960776991551488,"🎒 The Mochila Law: Prioritization and Entrepreneurship 🎒

Allow me to share a personal story that led me to discover the profound importance of prioritization and its connection to entrepreneurship. When I embarked on a nine-month journey through South America at the age of 21, I began with a backpack, or ""mochila,"" filled to its maximum capacity. Little did I know that this simple experience would teach me a valuable lesson about prioritizing and expanding our capabilities.

As I traversed different places and explored diverse cultures, I couldn't resist collecting souvenirs and mementos along the way. To my amazement, despite continuously acquiring new items, my mochila seemed to magically expand to accommodate them. This journey revealed an underlying truth: our capacity to handle more is often far greater than we initially perceive.

This realization holds significant parallels with the entrepreneurial journey. As entrepreneurs, we face a constant stream of opportunities, challenges, and responsibilities. Our metaphorical mochilas, representing our ability to handle these demands, may seem limited at first. Yet, as we navigate through the journey of building and growing our ventures, we discover that our capacity expands far beyond what we initially believed.

Prioritization becomes the key to unlocking our mochila's true potential. Just as I had to carefully choose which souvenirs to add to my backpack, entrepreneurs must consciously select which tasks, projects, and opportunities to prioritize. In a world of endless possibilities and limited resources, the ability to discern what truly matters and focus our energy accordingly becomes an essential skill.

The mochila law teaches us that prioritization is not about denying ourselves opportunities or experiences, but rather about making intentional choices that align with our vision and goals. It's about understanding that by carefully curating our focus, we can accomplish more, achieve greater impact, and avoid the overwhelm that often accompanies trying to do it all.

May your entrepreneurial mochila be filled with purpose, passion, and the right priorities to carry you to extraordinary heights.

7069226401249288192,"You have 56 weeks left. That's my estimate for cookie-pocalypse. I'm guessing that Google will get rid of 3P cookies in Chrome in mid-October 2024. A conservative estimate for getting a cookieless solution in place -- let's say 3 months (although if your internal teams are ready to go, we can launch an identity graph in ~ 6 weeks). That means you should have a solution ready to implement, purchased, and approved by your legal team by Sept. 4, 2024. That means you should start shopping for a solution at least a few months before that, so I estimate that the July 2, 2024 is the drop-dead deadline for starting the process of finding an identity alternative or supplementing your toolsets. 

Just to be clear, July 2, 2024 is the ""YIKES/PANIC/CHAOS"" date to find your cookie alternative; I recommend starting earlier than that. :) 

What is your guess for the cookie-pocalypse date? 

BTW, see comments below for a link to the identity graph buyer's guide that we put together a few months ago... 

I think the more often Google talks about the end of cookies in Chrome, the chances are higher that they'll stick to the deadline. We've been talking with Google reps at conferences, and in private they've been saying the same thing pretty consistently. If you've been following our social media, you know that we've been preparing for this day for the last 2 years. 

Roqad asserts the following:

- probabilistic identity resolution should be your primary alternative to third-party cookies
- Data Clean Rooms are a very interesting tool as well (especially when coupled with retail media networks) 
- the 3P cookie deprecation will disrupt, making this an exciting time for innovation in advertising
- we're happy about the end of third-party cookies, which is an old school piece of tech that needs to go, and we're excited about what we've built.
- you should demand maximum privacy and maximum insights from your vendors and partners

They just reported 😳 +14% sales growth in H1 23 and told the market, that 77% of their sales came from the outside of the Nordics. I don't know how much of that is from Amazon, but they look very convincing there as well.

🗓  It's been two years since I had the opportunity to be on stage at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference talking about Pinterest's mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. And equally about how we create a positive, inclusive experience for users. Remember very well that moment behind the stage before my slot started. Wow, have I been nervous 😉

✅ Our mission has not changed. The positivity and inclusivity continues to be unique to Pinterest and the user experience. But a lot has changed in the business: we have grown our business and this fab team remarkably. And we are still hiring (check out the latest roles here: https://lnkd.in/dYnUXQbX). 

💡 This year, it's going to be our biggest DMEXCO ever. With a keynote by Matt Crystal to ""Discover a new era of Performance on Pinterest"". Also, we'll be joined by our VP Europe Milka Privodanova to meet our partners at our space or in the CMO lounge.

Had such a lovely time keynoting at the World of Learning Conference at the Birmingham NEC this week.  Not every day you’re on the bill next to political commentator Robert Peston and TV personality Ruby Wax! 💫

It was huge fun being on stage with Ghassan Karian and sharing Ipsos UK data on the top traits of successful performance based organisations. 

Ipsos Karian and Box survey over 3 million employees per year all over the world and have distilled the most important traits of those who achieve the holy grail of both people and sustainable business performance. It was great to share this insight alongside my own 20 years of shaping organisations for the better. 

Thank you to the whole team in York and London who put the presentation together. 

Big shout out to a wonderful audience - loads of great questions, requests for more, tolerance at my chat GPT L&D jokes and trips down memory lane. 

To the great people I met and saw speak - Julian Stodd Helen Marshall Andy Lancaster Celine Floyd Stephanie Hopper Amy Brann Laura Overton

Thank you to Robin Hoyle for hosting and the whole WOL team.

Ah, DMEXCO – the go-to event in the world of digital marketing and tech! Let me take you to DMEXCO 2023, a year that was not only about staying connected with old pals but also about embracing new opportunities. 

You see, one of the sweetest things about DMEXCO '23 was the chance to bump into familiar faces from the past. It's like running into an old friend you haven't seen in ages – heartwarming and nostalgic. It reminded me that in this ever-changing industry, some bonds never break.

But DMEXCO wasn't just about reminiscing. No, no! It was also about looking ahead. The conference was a buzzing hive of new partnerships and fresh connections. We met folks and companies who shared our passion and dreams, and let me tell you, the excitement was contagious! I walked away from DMEXCO '23 with a big grin and a sense of purpose, ready to conquer what lay ahead.

I want to give a shout-out to everyone I had the pleasure of crossing paths with, having chats with, and sharing thoughts with at the conference. Those discussions were insightful, fun, and genuinely memorable. 

Thank you for making DMEXCO 2023 a remarkable experience! 🤝 🚀😊

""The Future in Germany is Migrant"" was the powerful slogan of the event that was divided into three parts: A panel discussion, engaging workshops, and networking with startups.  

I want to express my gratitude to Ana Álvarez - Founder and CEO of Migrapreneur ® for inviting me to participate in the panel discussion. It was an honor to share my journey and discuss the challenges I've faced as a migrant in Germany. Being part of such a meaningful conversation was a privilege.
I am deeply thankful to Migrapreneur for awarding me two scholarships through Coursera last year, specifically in UX Design and Digital Marketing and E-commerce. These opportunities not only enriched my skill set but also opened up new possibilities in my professional path. Being part of the Migrapreneur community has truly been a game-changer.

During the workshop sessions, I had the opportunity to attend Pedro Duarte's workshop, where he shared valuable insights into creating the podcast ""La Vida de Nosotros"" in Germany. The session was interesting and inspiring, offering a unique perspective on storytelling in a new cultural context.

Lastly, during the networking time, it was a pleasure connecting and exchanging experiences with mentors and experts like Arun M., Julieta Alvarez, and Manuel Sánchez .

Here's to the power of community, continuous learning, and the incredible journey of growth and connection

There were notable absentees too. Stand space was down and gone are the skyscraper booths we saw before Covid. Lots of chat about Privacy, Meta, Video and Social Commerce. More rumoured consolidations on the horizon for sure in adtech. 

Next year looks tough for some companies but it was good to see a lot of new startups. I hope funding continues to innovate this sector even through tough times. 

Also there is a dark side to this sector which the industry needs to work together on. Ad fraud funding criminal companies and unregulated messaging platforms promoting hate and child pornography content.

✅  Shifting B2B Buying Behaviors: The way businesses buy has evolved significantly. The avenues for vetting suppliers have multiplied, making it crucial for us to be present where our audience seeks information.

✅  Video as the Game-Changer: The audience consistently turns to video throughout their buying journey. Immersive video experiences make people more receptive to sales engagements.

✅  Video: The Most Impactful Tool: An astonishing 91% of marketers believe that video is our arsenal's most impactful marketing tool.

✅  Perception of Value: Interestingly, people often perceive video as an expensive endeavour. However, the value it brings far outweighs the investment.

✅  MOST IMPORTANTLY: Retention, Attention! The stats speak for themselves— we remember a mere 20% of what we read but a whopping 80% of what we watch in video content. And here's the kicker: analytics and video go hand in hand to unlock its full potential!

At DMEXCO, it became crystal clear that video isn't just an option; it's necessary for any forward-thinking marketing strategy. It's the medium that can connect us with our audience on a deeper level, driving engagement and conversion.

So, let's embrace the power of video, tell our stories, and create immersive experiences that resonate with our audience. 🚀

Consequently, brands are trying to find a new targeting approach.

One such brand is Mercedes-Benz AG-Benz that recently teamed up with Merkley + Partners to try out a cookieless targeting solution called SORT from Perion-owned Undertone.

The plan was to compare the results against both cookie-based targeting and contextual targeting.

As the name suggests, SORT sorts users into what are called “SmartGroups” by analysing real-time behavioural signals, presenting how people respond to and interact with rich-media ad placements.

Do you think that this method is a way to go, or should brands look for better solutions?

Listened to a great panel who shared how the project was brought to life. I’m obsessed with industrial parks so this was a highlight. Ran off the bus straight to the ‘NAIOP Gives Back’ event in partnership with U.S. Hunger. We collectively packaged 15,000 meals for people in need!! 

After that, I attended the conference reception to rep Altus Group’s property tax division with the team. Then went to various events hosted by BGO, JLL, SAXIUM LIMITED, Kimley-Horn Seyfarth Shaw LLP, Professional Service Industries, Inc. (PSI), and a couple more!

Converge was by far one of the best conferences I’ve attended. And a conference that gives back to the community is huge. Each session had outstanding information and esteemed speakers.

Our motto was “no Spain, no gain.” 

The saying is more true today than it was back then, especially looking at the amazing opportunities and connections that have come my way by being in Barcelona during weed week. 

Last year, Spannabis cracked my world wide open. It showed me how big the #cannabiscommunity really is and how far it spans, the brilliant minds growing and making hash in 60 different languages. Here’s my coverage from last time: https://lnkd.in/gKsiGwvK

The event is in its 20th year and yet is very underground, ie, not quite legal. Yes, there will be over 25k attendees and #cannabis is still not legal in Spain. Private clubs are the only safe haven for consumption. The culture is leading this revolution. 

I will be hopping around, here are some events you can catch me at: 

Spannabis
Women in Cannabis forum 
Hash Calabash 
The Ego Clash 
Legends of Hashish 
Masters of Rosin 
ICA 
Hash holes and Donuts

7069583291946852352,"What actually is Partner Management? - Part 7

After a short break the last weeks as of time-intensive offline events and vacation on my end, I am happy to continue this series about #partnermanagement.

Partner management is in general at the front row within the industry it is operating for several reasons. Researching the #industry and #market is necessary to develop the right understanding of the various players and #stakeholders the organization is surrounded by.
Searching for potential new #partnerhips and developing #relationships is one crucial functionality of partner management.
Whether these partnerships are #strategic, #service, or #sales partnerships is of secondary importance for the time being. The underlying function here is in each case #businessdevelopment. 
Once the relationship with the #partner is established, the focus is often on #leadgeneration. Again, this is a form of business development. 
Does this mean that partner management is business development? 
Business development lies at the heart of effective partner management. Without business development, partnerships can't be developed or used to their full potential. Partner management is, therefore, an important part of the organization's general business development and contributes to its general #success.

Recently I have received a lot of positive feedback on this post series. I am glad to know that my posts are actually read and help partner management #colleagues.

Special thanks for the personal feedback goes to Niels Bergmans Niklas Menke Benjamin Le Collen Jeffrey Jampoh Dominik Löwisch-Rückstein 🤝Will Taylor Bernhard Friedrichs.

7244648957841182721,"🎉 Exakt vor einer Woche öffnete die diesjährige Ausgabe der DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference ihre Tore. Und was soll ich sagen – ich bin immer noch überwältigt von den vielen positiven Eindrücken der beiden Tage. 
Angefangen beim Wiedersehen mit vielen langjährigen Wegbegleiter:innen über spannende neue Kontakte und die Ankündigung der neuen Partnerschaft zwischen Criteo und flaschenpost SE, zwei gesteckt volle Messestände bei Criteo und beim German Federal Association of the Digital Economy (BVDW e.V.) mit unzähligen guten Gesprächen, bis hin zu einem fantastischen Bühnenprogramm war die DMEXCO auch in diesem Jahr ein voller Erfolg!
 
Zu meinen persönlichen Highlights zählte vor allem der DMEXCO Retail Media Summit an Tag 1. Mit 17 hochkarätigen Vertreter:innen entlang der gesamten Wertschöpfungskette der Disziplin haben wir gemeinsam die Entwicklungen der letzten 12 Monate genau unter die Lupe genommen – und darüber gesprochen, wie viel wir im vergangenen Jahr mit vereinten Kräften erreicht & was wir uns für die Zukunft vorgenommen haben, um Retail Media in Deutschland und in Europa noch weiter nach vorne zu bringen. Daniel Knapp, Susanne Demmerling, Sabine Juenger, Christian Raveaux, Andreas Antrup, Robert Jozić, Marc Fischli, Lynne Kjolso, Chris Riegel, Jessica Wegner, Simon Piper, Christian Leihner, Marie-Clare Puffett, Eric St. Gemme, Dennie-Alexander Trost, Nikolaus Roettger und allen voran unsere Schirmherrin und RMC-Vorsitzende Patricia Grundmann – ihr habt den Retail Media Summit mit eurer Expertise und euren Impulsen unfassbar bereichert.
 
Auch in unserer BVDW-Masterclass an Tag 2 drehte sich alles um Retail Media. Unter der fachkundigen und kurzweiligen Moderation von Daniel Knapp konnten Dr. Jannika Bock, Robert Jozić und ich den aktuellen Stand von Retail Media in Deutschland diskutieren und vor allem darüber sprechen, wie alle Marktteilnehmer gleichermaßen das volle Potenzial der Mediengattung heben können. Ein großes Dankeschön an euch alle – und vor allem auch an die wunderbare Irina Schmitz für die perfekte Vorbereitung der Masterclass hinter den Kulissen!
 
Gestärkt mit so vielen positiven Impulsen geht’s jetzt erst einmal ins für unsere Branche so wichtige Q4. Und ich freue mich jetzt schon auf ein Wiedersehen im kommenden Jahr – der 17. und 18. September 2025 sind auf alle Fälle schon rot im Kalender markiert.

Die große Welle der Posts zur DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference und #DigitalX liegt hinter uns. Mit ein paar Tagen Abstand habe ich noch einmal reflektiert, was ich aus der Zeit in Köln mitnehme. 

Es begann mit einem Highlight: Ich durfte beim Pre-Event von CINTELLIC Consulting Group, ADITO Software GmbH und KNISTR gemeinsam mit Michael Fischer einen Gastvortrag zum Thema Loyalty Program Design halten. Der Austausch im Nachgang sowie die anschließende Diskussionsrunde u.a. mit Dr. Jörg Reinnarth, Markus Milz, Michael Bregulla, Dr. Mirjam Ringer, Stephan Klöckner und Julia Rosenberger haben wirklich Spaß gemacht und neue Perspektiven eröffnet! 

Ein großes Dankeschön an die Organisatoren für diesen gelungenen Auftakt!

Der darauffolgende Tag war geprägt von inspirierenden Momenten auf der Digital X und der DMEXCO. 

𝐇𝐢𝐞𝐫 𝐦𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬:

🔮 𝐃𝐢𝐞 𝐙𝐮𝐤𝐮𝐧𝐟𝐭 𝐢𝐬𝐭 𝐣𝐞𝐭𝐳𝐭: Tim Höttges begeisterte auf der Digital X mit seiner Keynote ""Sei der Wandel!"". Seine Vision einer vernetzten Welt war gleichermaßen faszinierend wie motivierend.

🏛️ 𝐃𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐞 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚 #𝐍𝐑𝐖: Ministerpräsident Hendrik Wüst präsentierte ambitionierte Pläne für die digitale Zukunft des Landes. Es war beeindruckend zu sehen, wie Wirtschaft und Politik schon heute an einem Strang ziehen.

😮 Ü𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐠: 𝐊𝐈 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐬: Auf der DMEXCO war KI das dominierende Thema. Es bleibt spannend zu beobachten, wie sich dies auf Marketing und Kundeninteraktion auswirken wird.

🛍️ 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐢𝐦 𝐅𝐨𝐤𝐮𝐬: Inzwischen war ein ganzer Hallenteil der DMEXCO diesem Thema gewidmet.

🎯 𝐋𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐄𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐫: Kundenbindungsprogramme spielen eine zentrale Rolle bei der Personalisierung von Werbung und der Optimierung der Customer Experience. Sie sind der Enabler, der u.a. Retail Media so kraftvoll macht.

👥 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭: Neben vielen neuen Kontakten und geplanten Treffen habe ich mich besonders über einige zufällige Wiedersehen gefreut, u.a. mit Prof. Dr. Nils O. Ommen, Torben Michael Theis und Dominik Risse. Solche Begegnungen machen Events wie diese so wertvoll!

🚀 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐩𝐬 𝐢𝐦 𝐑𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐭: Gespräche wie mit Dr. Timo Marks und Aldo Paeffgen von Perfect-iD / Personal information Data-Exchange über digitale Identitäten zeigte mir einmal mehr, wie wichtig der Blick über den Tellerrand ist.

𝐅𝐚𝐳𝐢𝐭: Die Digitalisierung schreitet weiter mit rasantem Tempo voran und verändert Geschäftsmodelle grundlegend. Wer erfolgreich sein will, muss agil bleiben, kontinuierlich lernen und vor allem: den Kunden in den Mittelpunkt stellen.

Ich freue mich schon jetzt auf das nächste Mal!

The World Transport Convention was our next stop with CEO Michael Caltabiano delivering a high-energy keynote speech to open the event. 

As part of the China-Australia technical exchange, the conference provided me the opportunity to present how road safety initiatives not only save lives but also drive economic and community benefits, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals to reduce global road deaths and injuries by half. I shared statistics around lives lost on Australian roads – and how this varies dramatically depending on where you live, NetRisk2 and Network Safety Plans using AusRAP Star Ratings. 

The exhibition hall was a dazzling display of lights, tech and innovations. 

Networking and site visit opportunities included:
🚙 JSTI to learn about how they are managing assets for maintenance and safety and optimising networks
🚢  Shandong Port Group where we met with leaders and key staff for a tour of this world-leading automated container port
🚦 Hisense Group Smart City  for a tour of their showroom filled with new and upcoming urban mobility technology.

Apple’s decision to eliminate IDFA with the launch of iOS 14 forced the industry to do some serious soul searching and naturally led to a scramble for new solutions. 

But, it certainly didn’t mean the end of effective advertising on mobile. Yet advertisers and tech companies had to rethink what it means to provide relevant ads to users and how they do it.

7030887437757202432,,"I worked very hard for 25 years trying to get rich and happy.

I had good jobs that I loved, a nice family, and possessions. 
But I was neither rich nor happy.

Then one day, in a strange sequence of events, this happened:

I found a place in nature with no internet and no shops.
Then I just started walking. For one month.

First, I felt strong withdrawal symptoms from all my bad habits 
- checking phone constantly
- buying useless stuff
- social media
- alcohol
- TV

The fitness level was also not good in the beginning. 
My legs hurt and got sore.

My thoughts raced around the job at home, how to get more money, what friends are doing, the dream house and the must-have new car.


But after a while, the monotonous walk, the physical exercise, the forced disconnect, and the beautiful nature worked their magic.


I started being in the moment, enjoying the moment. 
I had nowhere else to be.

All my fears disappeared. Everything was stripped away. I
- compared to nothing
- bought nothing
- had nothing
- had nothing to lose.

Slowly my eyes got fresh, my view of the world and life changed.

That dream house was no longer a dream, 
the new car was no longer needed.

Now I got showered with happiness and saved a ton of money.

I finally became happy by 
- living in the present moment
- being grateful for what I have
- owning my most precious asset of time.

I finally got rich by 
- comparing less
- spending less
- needing less
- fearing less
- caring less

I don't have a lot of money. I just realized that I don't need a lot, and then I got rich and happy with what I have.
(All the credit to my wife, who showed me the way😍)

Then the next strange thing happened back home:
When you need less and fear less, you get more.
Life starts to flow and glow.
That’s for the next story.

Where-ever you are in life, you may want to try this.
In 1 month I got, what I couldn't get in 25 years. Insane

You can easily bring your partner and kids. 
That will make the riches and happiness even bigger.

7243880591467626496,"🌟 Reflecting on the #DMEXCO2024 –AI was everywere , showing how it’s transforming how we work, we market and we produce content. But creativity remains essential. Robert Andersen from Jung von Matt highlighted that while AI speeds up processes and boosts productivity, creativity isn’t getting cheaper—in fact, it’s becoming more valuable as a unique human skill in this tech-driven era.

Kudos to Jan Nicolas Koenig for curating an inspiring lineup at the Collective Stage. Jasper Börnsen emphasized that AI strategy goes beyond tech—it’s about embedding AI into the company’s culture, identifiying the right tools, and offering relevant services for real transformation. Good seeing you guys again!

😌 Claire Valoti, VP of Snap, said that 82% of Gen Z prefer brands that use images of real customers in advertising. So, real people, we are rejecting this ""perfect imaginary"" (it's about time);

🤖 She also showed how shopping is becoming more about the person, and not about the product, and how AR is facilitating that (you can ""try on"" virtually your sneakers, change the color of your nails, and so on), to make sure we can create a sustainable experience for costumers but also for the planet;

🏋 Chris Babayode, Managing Director EMEA at MMA, showed the Modern Marketing Capability map, with 18 areas and 72 areas of expertise for me and my fellow marketers to work on.

🙃 Caroline Hugonenc, SVP Research & Insights at Teads.com, preached for the user's freedom, saying that forced ads require 2x more time to deliver the same impact; 

🗒️ Jens-Christian Jensen, CSO, Digitas Pixelpark, brought the CMO agenda for 2023, with item 4 (Empower your talents and let them make decisions) resonating strongly with me;

🏆 And lastly, but not less important, Alina Kuhnert's presentation ""Don't panic with complex product data"" was the talk of the day, with lots of practical insights! Looking forward to having it in English as well to share here.

7232724710797496320,"Is #Tiktok already out😱? The next gen of consumers spends more time on 🤖 #Roblox than on Tiktok. Among 13 to 15-year-olds, it is 138 minutes per day (vs 127 on Tiktok). The difference is even clearer among 10 to 12-year-olds: 143 versus 121 minutes. 

This suggests that the future belongs to #gaming platforms 🎮. Anyone who, like me today, dives into gamescom won't be surprised. The global market is worth around 280 billion USD. Growth of around 10 % each year is forecasted. #InGameAdvertising alone is expected to generate 102 billion euros 💰📈. 

But there is still room for improvement. Only a few brands are active in gaming. During COVID the marked expected a boom, but gaming platforms have yet to achieve a breakthrough as a media channel. 

After all, advertising in the gaming environment is not that easy. Many marketers have had problems with Tiktok. But immersing yourself in gaming environments is a completely different challenge. In these parallel worlds, you have different cultural codes, languages, and ways of interacting🤖. A brand has to know them if it wants to present itself credibly there.  

This is complex and requires people who know the communities and who can develop creative, customised, immersive brand experiences ♥. Because individual experiences are the current trend. Standardised, programmatically bookable in-game ads may be simpler and cheaper, but they are often boring and with little impact. 

Brand experiences, on the other hand, trigger engagement and create added value without disrupting the gaming experience. This is particularly important in premium games in order to create acceptance. 

Good in-game marketing is currently a small-scale, manual task that makes this channel very expensive for brands. However, the market is still at an early stage. More complex formats will be able to be booked automatically in the future. For example, three-dimensional objects, branded avatars 🕺🏾💃🏼 or logos that can be customised using a modular principle.

7191079024570306560,"My personal review of the HANNOVER MESSE week 2024: Business thrives on personal connections.

I am still overwhelmed by the myriad of great impressions, especially from the amazing people I had the privilege to meet last week at the HANNOVER MESSE 2024, particularly at the Application Park in hall 5.

A few weeks ago, someone who isn't involved in trade shows asked me, ""Are trade fairs still relevant? With so many digital ways to gather information, why would people still attend trade fairs?""

Spoiler alert: Yes, trade fairs are definitely still relevant—especially in the era of new work and digitalization. 

Last week reaffirmed that, ultimately, business is conducted between people. There's a unique dynamic when individuals meet face-to-face, share a coffee or beer, engage in spontaneous brainstorming sessions, and discuss the technical challenges they face in order to forge new partnerships and find solutions.

A heartfelt thank you to all the wonderful individuals and fascinating personalities among the Application Park exhibitors of 2024! From the outset, we've fostered a fantastic sense of community, and I eagerly anticipate what 2025 holds for all of us.

This headline could appear as early as 2040 in digital industry publications. The figure stems from the McKinsey Global Institute’s Report, which identifies digital advertising as one of the core technologies set to drive economic growth through 2040.

So, what do these 90 percent mean in absolute terms? In 2022, digital ad revenues reached $520 billion. By 2040, these revenues could soar to $2.9 trillion in the more optimistic scenarios. Besides the ongoing shift from traditional to digital channels, four key factors fuel this evolution:

1️⃣ Global middle class growth
2️⃣ Increased consumer attention on digital media
3️⃣ Positive ROI of digital ads
4️⃣ New digital media formats

But who will benefit the most from this growth? Currently, a few walled gardens dominate the market. In the future, we might see new platforms emerge – both global and local ones. The structure of these future channels will shape the data set companies can use to target customers. Additionally, AI is poised to dramatically alter the customer journey. 

This brings up more than just the question of how AI will affect the market and which media channels will emerge. It also raises questions about how AdTech solutions can keep the open web attractive for advertisers, how branding strategies might evolve as available channels focus on performance, and, of course, how pricing will develop within this ecosystem.

🛒 𝗔𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗠𝗰𝗞𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗲𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗲-𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲. 

#eCommerce generated around $4 trillion in 2022, and by 2040, this could reach $14 to $20 trillion, according to the study. The online share of non-food segments could climb as high as 38 percent.

Growth will come from emerging markets with expanding middle classes. But the researchers also see potential in developed regions like North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific, where new e-commerce categories still offer growth opportunities. Categories that appeal to customers’ emotions show strong potential for #SocialCommerce, which could become a major industry driver.

All in all, McKinsey predicts that e-commerce will achieve the following shares by 2040: 
🌎 North America - 50 percent
🌏 Asia-Pacific - 40 percent
🌍 Europe - 36 percent

With these good news for the industry, I wish you a wonderful weekend!

The main trend is that we’re no longer bragging about AI — we're using it. All attention now 📌 -  how AI can enhance our product and user experience.


1. AI is the New Ad Prodigy: Forget cookie-cutter  strategies. AI is stepping in like a genius intern that knows everyone’s coffee order *and* how to optimize your ad spend. Expect smarter audience targeting, better campaign results, and fewer creepy ads following you around.

2. Retail Media is Having a Moment: Retail media is the new “it” platform—taking first-party data from e-commerce and turning it into ultra-precise ads. It’s like getting a perfect gift without even dropping a hint. All your favorite shops can now show you an ad and share your data with a ""community"". 

3. Privacy is the New Black: Brands are ditching third-party cookies and going all-in on first-party data. Why? Because consumers want transparency, not surprise tracking. Think of it like dating—honesty gets you further.

4. First-Party Data Takes Center Stage: Say goodbye to third-party cookies (eventually) and hello to first-party data—the good stuff you collect directly from customers. It’s like cooking at home instead of ordering takeout. Healthier, tastier, and way more in control.

5. Programmatic Ads & DOOH: Programmatic ad buying is growing up, moving into fancy digital billboards and DOOH (Digital Out-of-Home). Now your ads can appear both on your phone and while you're waiting for the bus. we talked about it for ages, but now I saw it in real-time...

6. Video is Still King, but Add AR/VR to the Mix: People are glued to their phones and love video. Brands are making them even stickier with immersive experiences like AR/VR. Soon, watching a video might feel more like living in one.

7. Cookies Aren’t Dead, but They’re on Life Support: Third-party cookies are still hanging on, but the party’s winding down. First-party data is taking over, with tools like hashed emails helping brands target without being creepy.

These trends show where digital marketing is heading: smarter, more privacy-conscious, and definitely more immersive. Keep up, or be left out in the digital cold!

#dmexco2024 #adapex","This week, Laura Pes attended DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference, Europe’s leading digital marketing and tech event, where the theme was “Prompting the Future.” It was an incredible opportunity to explore how new technologies are shaping the future of marketing and communication.

While there, Laura had insightful discussions with industry thought leaders like Joseph Muldoon (Magnite), Daria Oshry (OMS), and Ivgeni Nemerzel (Rise). They exchanged ideas on the creative potential of AI and how it’s driving innovation in digital advertising. She also had a productive lunch with Rachel Shekhtman (Browsi).

I was amazed by the presence of numerous retailers at the conference, such as OBI Group Holding, OTTO, and Lidl in Germany. It felt more like a retail event than a marketing and tech-focused conference. Of course, there were also many exhibitors showcasing the #eCommerce industry! 🛍️

In the startup valley, I noticed several services dedicated to eCommerce, including analytics, ad campaign optimization, A/B testing, creative work, post-view and post-click optimization, conversions, and attributions. This was a significant highlight compared to previous years.

I want to emphasize the industry's growing trend of retail and AI. One of the talks that stood out to me was by Birk Angermann from Shopify. The ""Imagine the AI-Powered Future of Commerce"" was genuinely captivating. It delved into how cutting-edge technology could shape the future of most businesses.

The conference attracted many attendees, giving it a genuinely European vibe. It was great to see business partners and people I know personally there. While I had the opportunity to attend some fantastic speakers and live meetings on the first day, the second day was dedicated to networking and connecting with my business partners 🤝

The only downside was that some talks were conducted in German without English translation, making it challenging to understand the content. However, overall, it was an amazing conference, and I'm already looking forward to attending next year! 🎉

It's clear that we need to focus more on the role of GCC and particularly Dubai in entering the international market and positioning our company and product effectively there.

Alhamdullilah, This past February 17th, I had the privilege of being part of a brilliant event in Almaty, Kazakhstan - the Digital Umma IT Forum, hosted at Nur-Mubarak University. It was a pioneering gathering for Muslim tech enthusiasts, attracting over 1600 applications and 1000+ participants. This forum wasn’t just an event; it was a celebration of innovation, where 30+ expert speakers from leading Islamic startups and top tech companies shared their insights and visions for the future.

The feedback from both speakers and attendees was overwhelmingly positive, with many commending the event's high level of organization and the quality of interactions it facilitated.

In my role as a designer and marketing strategist, I contributed across multiple dimensions: visual identity that included the branding and logo, developing the UI/UX for the event website (digital-umma.com), designing presentations for sponsors and the event's physical decoration. Most importantly I led our marketing on Instagram, with a video invitation that went viral (+43K views), boosting our community to over 3000 followers and ensuring our content, including reels, that consistently received thousands of views. Check our page: 

https://lnkd.in/gAvHjq6d

I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this remarkable event and am excited to carry forward the insights and experiences gained as I continue to explore the intersection of design, technology, and social impact.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making the Digital Umma IT Forum a success. I hope and pray to be part of more such events that bring the innovation and social good to both umma and world.

Historical industry statistics don't lie: between 2000 and 2014 alone, clothing production doubled, and consumers began buying 60 percent more clothes and wearing them for half as long as before. In the world today, more than 100 billion pieces of clothing are produced per year for a global population of 8 billion people.

Is there a solution to this reality? 

Appeal to a change in habits, but also the use of new inputs and fabrics of forest origin that consume a third of the energy and 60 times less water when compared to a synthetic fiber or cotton.

This was one of the topics addressed at the Milan conference “Challenge the Fabric 2024”, which focused on sustainability, traceability and innovation in materials in the fashion industry and challenged designers to create sustainable looks to promote a shift towards bio-based and recycled materials.

We had the opportunity to share Arauco’s sustainability practices in this challenging times and some trends that we see are going to happen in the future. New regulations, Ecosystem Services at Landscapes, and Nature Positiveness where some of them.

It’s always a pleasure when an exhibition goes beyond just business and transforms into an exchange of ideas, knowledge, and—let’s be honest—quite a few laughs! 

Meeting my amazing new team the first time in person, catching up with our fantastic customers, and forming new partnerships was definitely a highlight. 💼🤝

This year, Gen AI and its role in Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) stole the show. But here’s the kicker: while it may sound like a simple topic, anyone in the field knows that real, long-term success doesn’t come from shortcuts. It comes from testing, refining, and testing again. There’s no magic formula – just hard work, data, and a commitment to improving the user experience, because at the end of the day, that’s what keeps customers coming back. 🔄

At the heart of CRO is making your customers feel valued, making it easy for them to engage, and ensuring their experience is smooth as butter. And guess what? That never goes out of style! 🧈✨

Onward to more testing, more optimizing, and more customer success stories! 🎉

	1.	Brands have never been more important. Gen Z and Gen Y are heavily influenced by brands when making decisions.
	2.	Happy and excited CEOs do exist! Great brand stories and approaches shared by the CEO Philip Hitschler-Becker of a candies brand Hitschies. Non-usual approach how to build brand via the content and basically being a part of the content. 
	3.	From the 10 principles of Kapton&Son and Charles Chairman Artjem Weissbeck  I was reminded how rewarding it is to tap into the new areas and to scale new on its early stages. Check out their value creation solutions via WhatsApp
	4.	Henkel  showcased how to generate 1M impressions for the employer brand by turning employees into company influencers! And I think it is great to showcase a company’s vibe. As a Henkel employee, I’m adding my own voice with this post , even though it would be better to post from Monday to Thursday on this platform ))). And this journey is guided by Céline Flores Willers - great speaker with strong insights and a great representative of women in business. 
	5.	As a former Nestlé employee, it was exciting to hear Perrier Global Business Director Elisa Gregory talk about Perrier’s rejuvenation—being strong at the core while allowing the brand’s identity to stretch. I loved hearing about the launch of Maison Perrier. Big brand, big responsibility, big budgets—scaling right from the start. My two favorite Nestlé brands? Perrier and Nestlé Nespresso SA (Irene Balascas always happy to read your success stories) So the 5th point is a bit driven by my personal attachment.

With the rise of AI, it’s never been easier to create content. But let’s face it - a lot of it lacks real value, you need to modify it.

👉 The real task?

Create content that truly matters. Make it so valuable that your audience wouldn’t just swipe and go - they’d find it worth paying for.

While our team is attending the INBOUND event in Boston, I took a wee break to enjoy the Italian Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Temple of Speed.

Attending reminded me not only how much I love F1 but also of all the business lessons one can learn from this sport.

F1 is a prime example of:
🤝 Great teamwork - the driver and the team need to trust each other, communicate openly, and work together seamlessly
🧩 The importance of strategy - you can have the fastest car in the world but a wrong strategic decision can get you off the podium (cough Ferrari cough)
🌊 Adaptability - teams have to embrace change as anything from the weather to accidental contact can affect their performance
🔄 Continuous optimisation - by collecting and analysing their data the teams are able to improve their performance, even in real-time
🏆 Having a winning attitude - even when things go wrong, it’s important to focus on the goal, take the learnings, and go to the next race ready to fight back

F1 is so much more than just fast cars, so if you get a chance to watch a race, give it a go!

🇩🇪  The German Retail Media market is booming and full of innovation -  the dedicated retail media corner with OBI Group Holding Schwarz Gruppe Kaufland Deutschland REWE Group Douglas and many more showcasing their offering. 

📊 Germany is the second biggest market in Western Europe behind the UK, but will experience significant growth over the next few years. Next year (according to EMARKETER) will see a 24% YoY growth - https://lnkd.in/e-eGZ3Ux 

For those that were on the fence about going and didn't, I whole heartedly recommend next year - A case of less is more when compared to my last visit pre pandemic (or maybe I am getting old)

✅  Less halls - easier to navigate
✅  Less exhibitors - less cluttered, more space easier to see who is exhibiting
✅ Less people - no more free tickets meant a more focused crowd

Finally, as always with these events it's brilliant to catch up with partners, explore new opportunities and bump into old colleagues and friends.

Five years ago, if you’d told me I’d return to DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference as an HR ambassador, I wouldn’t have believed you. Back in my e-commerce days, DMEXCO was all about products and marketing campaigns. 

This year, however, I took the stage with a new focus: how employee experience directly shapes customer experience and ultimately defines brand value. 💡

The challenge? Too often, we talk about “employer brand” and “employer branding campaigns” without addressing the deeper need for strategic alignment between Marketing and HR. 

The truth is, an employee’s experience directly influences the customer’s experience and, therefore, the strength of the brand.

In my session, “Human Experience at Work: Backwards to a Brand that Moves Us,” I shared how we at HRS Group are working on aligning our ways of working with the promises we make to customers. 

By applying our Leading Principles, we are fostering a work environment where employees live and breathe the competencies needed to enhance the customer experience and therefore the brand value step by step. 🔄

The hack: This alignment not only elevates the customer experience but also attracts professionals who resonate with our mission, fostering innovation and meaningful work.

Being back at DMEXCO was incredible - same energy, but from a new perspective. Thanks to everyone who joined the discussions!

Someone at my son's school stated the kids will hopefully be the generation that figures out how to clone (or at least beam) somebody, as she could really use it. Thinking of next week, I feel the same. 

The week before DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference is also the week before German Federal Association of the Digital Economy (BVDW e.V.) #OnlineAdSummit (OAS) and VideoWeek Cologne plus making final decisions who to meet at what time and where - as well as listening to some of the amazing content that's on offer.

That's how I solve it: I plan everything around my fixed speaking slots (of course) and the goals and values I have set for myself - translating into the people and content I want to listen to and interact with as well as including some selfcare time. 

Here are some of my fixed slots:

17th of September, attending German Federal Association of the Digital Economy (BVDW e.V.) OAS Summit in the morning till early afternoon - shout out to my SDA Lab Lead Partner Lisa Vieweg, Steffen Hubert or Nadja Schick who will be on stage. Really looking forward to your sessions.

Same day, I will make a quick switch from OAS to #VideoWeek 's #VideoWeekCologne to join a panel around the question How the Next-Gen Premium Media Ecosystem could look like hosted by Vincent Flood

18th is focussed on conversations and content.

19th I will host the session ""Responsible Media: Warum Verantwortung übernehmen auch eine Business Entscheidung ist."" at BVDW Masterclass (MC7A) 13:45 - 14:15 Thanks to Beatriz Bilfinger for your brilliant organisation.

Maybe we could meet at the stage of #dmexco, bring an international expert client from retail and some of the vendors.","Wie entwickelt sich die Gattung Retail Media in der näheren Zukunft? Die DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference hat sieben führende Mediaagenturen und die Initiative Retail Media des Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW) e.V. nach ihrer Einschätzung befragt. Das Fazit in Kürze: Die meisten Agenturen erwarten ein zweistelliges Wachstum der Gattung - so viele wie in keinem anderen Marketingkanal - und eine ""glorreiche Zukunft"". In der praktischen Arbeit kämpfen die befragten Agenturen überwiegend mit fehlenden Standards und allgemein gültigen Erfolgskennzahlen. Die Vielzahl der E-Retailer und deren unterschiedliche Planungsangebote führe zu einer hohen Komplexität bei der Planung und Umsetzung von Kampagnen. Zudem seien die Self-Service-Tools für Agenturen zum Teil noch ausbaufähig. Die ausführlichen Einschätzungen der befragten Expert:innen (Florian Berger, Patricia Grundmann, Moritz Hoffmann, Mira London, Laurence Phillips, Babak Ravanbakhsh, Uwe Roschmann, Anna Sibbing und Ron Warncke) stellt die DMEXCO in einem ausführlichen Special und einem Whitepaper ab sofort auf ihrer Website zur Verfügung.

I’ve been thinking about how to honor Hispanic Heritage Month in a way that is enough. Authentic enough, informed enough, and meaningful enough to matter. And I’ll admit that I’ve had writer’s block on this topic, which has led me here to this final day of this lovely month of respect and appreciation for the rich cultures of the Hispanic diaspora.
 
But last week on a long flight, I read a book. A real hard copy book, and this book called ""Life and Death of the American Worker: The Immigrants Taking on America's Largest Meatpacking Company"", helped to unblock me with the power of storytelling, the necessity of empathy and care, and the proximity to my home state and even my hometown. This is not an ad, and I am not an affiliate. But my one caveat before I go on, is that the author is my first cousin, and I am naturally a bit biased.
 
This book documents the life of both legal and illegal immigrants and refugees coming to the United States to make a better life, who end up working at Tyson, one of the mainstay companies fueling the Arkansas economy. Most of these immigrants are Hispanic, many do not speak English well, some are illiterate, all are vulnerable. And this book is hard to read – not because the prose is difficult or overly fancy (it's not), but because the topic is tough. This book feels personal. There are mentions of my tiny hometown and the Tyson plant there - a place I've driven by a million times. There are mentions of a college friend’s father who went to prison in the 90s while working at Tyson, a memory that I had completely lost but that came flooding back with great precision. There is discussion of the NGOs who help settle refugees and immigrants in Arkansas and then funnel them into the chicken pipeline that runs like a constant loop of backbreaking work, untreated injuries, gaslighting, and more.
 
This book is hard to read.
 
But it’s also beautiful, bringing forth the dreams people have to make a better life, to take care of their families even at great cost to themselves, to raise children who have more opportunities than their parents had, and to build community with shared values and goals.
 
My experience with Hispanic Heritage has been long and rich. From living in Peru as a child and traveling around South America with my weaving parents; to my dad’s experience living in Mexico for over 20+ years; to earning my MBA from an international program and meeting so many remarkable Spanish speaking humans; to one of the best managers I ever had who was a cigar smoking Mexican man and a thoughtful, smart, and kind leader. All of this - these people and experiences - have enriched my life, taught me meaningful lessons, and shown me what it means to create joy from even the smallest spark of possibility.

This book is hard to read. But it’s also important to read. I hope you’ll honor it and the Hispanic people whose lives it chronicles with the gift of your time and mindshare.

Thank you Ryan D. Taylor and Taj Ahmad Eldridge for hosting the Diverse Climate Tech Eco-System event. I left feeling inspired and motivated by the sweet community of people I met there! Environments that reflect the world affirm that representation matters and it is up to us to create the spaces we want to see in the world. 🧡  It also sounds like Energy is a hot investment these days~

Carbon Newbie Summit hosted by Michelle Li was a blast! I learned that professionals who have experience working in the climate space still feel like newbies since the industry is rapidly changing with new research, innovation, and policies. You can view speaker details, stream the event recording, and calculate your carbon footprint at carbonnewbie.com, but here are just a few of the many interesting highlights:

>The average American emits ~15 tons of CO2 per capita a year...the global average is 6.3 tons. 

>Emails: Send links to folders vs. attach files because a normal email is .3g CO2e and attachments are upwards 50g CO2e.

>Private Jets are 5 -14x more polluting per passenger than commercial flights.

>PPM = parts per million (#/1million air particles)
*Pre-industrial levels we were at 280ppm of CO2
*As of March, we are at 427.0 ppm of CO2
*Scientists say we should not surpass 450ppm of CO2
We have work to do!

>Allbirds is changing the footwear and apparel space by labeling every product with the amount of carbon it took to produce. Michelle said, ""We see calories for our food but we really don't see [carbon label measurements]"". It reminded me of a brainstorming conversation I had with my Climatebase fellow María Fernanda L.! Wouldn't it be awesome if we could access that information when we shop? I believe it would motivate greener decisions for brands and consumers. Jeanne Hartshorn is working on it with other fellows, I'm excited to see how it goes!

","What a week it’s been so far – and it’s only Tuesday!

I had the chance to stop by the Seamless Europe event in Munich for the past two days. For a first edition, it was good, but I would have chosen a different venue. The Messe München venue made the event feel a bit scattered in my opinion.

The presentations and panels I attended were insightful, featuring top-notch speakers from the global trade scene. However, the exhibition itself was heavily focused on fintech and startups – I was hoping to see more representation of Commerce, CX, or DXP.

With RetailX happening simultaneously, perhaps it’s worth reconsidering the dates next year to avoid overlap.

All in all, for a free event, it’s definitely worth the time. While it’s still an extension of the Seamless MENA series from Dubai and Riyadh, the Munich edition hasn’t reached that same level yet.

His work ethic is impeccable, and his diligence to chip away at his studies every night after long work days and so much work travel always amazes me.  
 Nicholas Brown, you are a rock star, and CONGRATULATIONS!  You did it! #graduate #missionaccomplished ","Hi Folks, 
 
I’m excited to announce that I’ll be interning at Tesla in the Sales and Service organization for the Spring 2023 semester! 
 
I typically only share job posting on this site, but this has been a long time coming for me. I've been chipping away at taking night classes over the past 15 years to earn my bachelor’s degree, starting with doing homework on top of my toolbox on my lunch breaks at Airport Road Auto Body Inc. Nothing like trying to read the required text for class with an air hammer snapping off in the background 😂. In those years I’ve changed jobs numerous times , relocated across country several times for work, attended different colleges where credits didn’t transfer and had to take classes again, took on too many classes at night and had to withdraw, struggled through retaking classes more than once because I didn’t understand the content, had senior work leaders act as proctors for my exams, completed homework from hotel rooms and airports from all over the world as I traveled for work – United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, China, Hong Kong, and Australia. 
 
The picture below embodies the behind-the-scenes effort of what I went through of reteaching myself basic math through Calculus
online, after almost 15 years of no math classes – with of course a celebratory drink at the completion of the class 😊. This a great example of what my working professional peers and myself went

So many things resonated for me during this energizing chat, perhaps most significant is her view that we all have a role to play in creating a better ecosystem centered around privacy and transparency for consumers.

Ogilvy UK, DAVID Madrid and DAVID São Paulo have won a Grand Prix together at Cannes. Our Dove #TurnYourBack campaign has won a Grand Prix and a Gold in Media, and a Bronze in Social and Influencer, at Cannes Lions. What a night. 

Congratulations to each and everyone involved, especially to the powerhouse  Daniel Fisher, Lindsey Gonnella and Jo Bacon who lead from the front, our influencer and creative legends, including Rahul Titus, David Anderson and ian brassett, and of course DAVID Madrid and DAVID São Paulo, who we did it with. It truly takes brilliant talent to make such impact - client and agency side. 
Do watch the case study, link in the comments.

Daniel Fisher, Global Executive Creative Director, Ogilvy:
“Watching how we all came together as a global network to turn this around in a matter of days, from brief to going live, gave me goosebumps. It brought back memories of ‘Courage is Beautiful, and I’m sure this will have just as much impact. #turnyourback was a truly integrated campaign in every sense, developed within hours by Ogilvy UK and DAVID Madrid, with production assistance from DAVID São Paulo. From the outset we leveraged earned, social, influence and creativity, all working in perfect harmony to maximum effect. Filters like Bold Glamour might feel like a bit of fun - but they are potent tools that are destroying the self-esteem of millions of young girls. We have to take a stand.”

▶️ Interact with your audience after you posted something on LinkedIn. It's a social media platform and not a TV.

▶️ Reuse your content and post it with a good comment again 4 or 6 weeks later. Maybe also use a different format. Transfer a video post into a text post!

I know it sounds like a contradiction in terms, but that's just how I roll.

Anyway, I wanted to share a few snaps from the speech and some of my thoughts on the experience. 

The thing is, I actually really like the idea of a prepared speech. It's like a ray of hope for my chronically disorganized self.

The speech was about mid-life, and its implicit crisis, and it felt a bit surreal to look at people and see them smiling or even laughing along the way - especially when they could relate to what I was saying. 🥹

But here's the thing - as much as I loved the idea of a prepared speech and the thrill of the contest, I realized that gazillion rehearsals and rigid evaluations that leave no room for impro just weren't for me, feels somehow less authentic.

Or maybe I'm just a bit bitter about not going further in the competition. 👀

 I'll tell myself that's not the case and keep writing stuff and turning them into vulnerable speeches. 
It's like exposure therapy, and I highly recommend it. 
Cheerio! 🙃

✨ Imagine an event that seamlessly brings together the Marketing and Tech industries. Well, DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference is even more than that! Every September, Cologne-Germany transforms into a vibrant hub of innovation, discovery, networking, and of course, fun times together.

🎤 Last week, I had the privilege of joining another DMEXCO, returning as a speaker. I joined the IAB Europe - Attitudes for programmatic panel alongside industry colleagues like 💫 Cadi Jones, 💫 Carol Starr, 💫 Schwab Ingo, and 💫 Wayne Tassie. We delved into compelling conversations around why programmatic investments keep growing year on year, the key drivers of programmatic, and reflecting on third-party cookies alternatives.

🚀 DMEXCO is the ultimate destination for inspiration. I immersed myself in sessions on the New Era of Search, Generative AI, Retail Media, Gaming, Programmatic, and more. Two days of intense learning from the best in the field, making it the premier event to get inspired and educated on the latest trends.

🤝 But it’s not just about the sessions. It’s about the people – connecting with clients, partners, agencies, publishers and making new industry contacts. For me, it was also about meeting my amazing colleagues from Microsoft Advertising in person at the Microsoft booth. We sparked conversations in Cologne that will continue to flourish in the coming weeks.

📅 If you haven’t experienced DMEXCO yet and you’re eager to connect your brand and yourself in the Martech industry, get inspired on how to boost your business, and find the right partners to make it happen, start planning your participation for 2025!

👋 If you missed it and still want to learn more about Microsoft Advertising, please reach us... no need to wait for the next DMEXCO 😉

7143169796631703552,"En un mundo cada vez más digital, las marcas deben evolucionar sus estrategias de marketing para conectarse de manera efectiva con su audiencia. Un canal emergente que merece nuestra atención es el advergaming, y más aún, el mundo de los videojuegos en la web3.
METAVERSE FASHION COUNCIL ha publicado un estudio muy interesante argumentando por qué los #videojuegos y la #web3 son la publicidad del futuro - y no tan futuro- y por qué como marca deberías plantearte el uso de estos medios poco convencionales. 
El estudio destaca la creciente importancia de involucrar a las marcas en el universo del #advergaming y los #videojuegos basados en la #web3. Como profesional, para mi estas son algunas de las razones clave por las que las marcas deberían considerar seriamente esta forma de publicidad y fidelización:
Engagement Inigualable: Los videojuegos ofrecen un nivel de participación sin precedentes. La interactividad y la inmersión proporcionadas por el advergaming generan experiencias memorables que perduran en la mente del jugador.
Conexión Emocional: Los videojuegos tienen el poder de crear conexiones emocionales duraderas. Al incorporar la marca en la trama del juego, se establece una relación más profunda y auténtica con el usuario.
Público Diverso y Global: La comunidad de jugadores abarca todas las edades y demografías, lo que significa que las marcas pueden llegar a audiencias diversas y globales a través del advergaming.
Inmersión en la #Web3: La web3 introduce nuevas posibilidades, como la propiedad de activos digitales y la tokenización. Al participar en juegos basados en web3, las marcas pueden explorar modelos de negocio innovadores y experiencias únicas para los usuarios.
Fidelización del Cliente: El #advergaming en la web3 no solo atrae a nuevos clientes, sino que también fortalece la lealtad de los existentes. Los jugadores disfrutan interactuar con marcas que comparten sus intereses, creando así una comunidad comprometida.
Las marcas que abrazan la evolución hacia el advergaming y los videojuegos en la web3 están posicionándose para el éxito en el futuro del marketing digital. La combinación de tecnología innovadora, engagement excepcional y conexiones emocionales sólidas ofrece oportunidades sin límites. Claro ejemplo de ello es que firmas de la talla de McDonald's, adidas o Kellanova han confiado en empresas especializadas en advergaming como Playoffnations para lanzar estrategias disruptivas dentro de entornos virtuales conocidas como Roblox o Rocket League
Sin duda, es el momento de sumergirse en el universo del advergaming y web3 gaming y dar un giro emocionante a las estrategias de marca.

GingerMay #marketing #pr #podcast","Chuffed to say the Stand Up Marketing Podcast is now out there 🎉  

Each episode I am joined by an expert to showcase and explore a different area of SaaS marketing to let you know what works and what doesn't, as well as provide ideas that can immediately make a difference to your marketing.

In the first episode I zero in on how to do SaaS PR properly with guest Victoria Usher, CEO & Founder of multi-award winning PR & Communications agency GingerMay .

We cover:
🔷 When is the right and wrong time to start investing in PR?
🔷 What common mistakes do organisations make in executing their PR strategy?
🔷 How has SaaS PR evolved over the last decade and where is it headed?
🔷 Where does PR sit in the funnel?
🔷 How do you measure the value?

I educate my children to be careful with their data and not to share their faces online until they are 18 years old. So it's unworthy of discussion that I break this rule for them.

And we all need to be aware of what's possible now and will be in the future! Not only for our children - also for ourselves. 

I strongly believe in the good of #AI. But my perspective is that it also can be used for the bad. Like everything! 

It's important to be aware of it and to understand it. You'll find some more information at Deutsche Telekom's website: https://lnkd.in/exhyhEQQ

DMEXCO 2023 was a special highlight for me. As an intern in B2B Online Marketing at Douglas Marketing Solutions, I had the opportunity to organize our booth with Linn Rödenbeck and Jessica Koch.

This marked the first time Douglas Marketing Solutions had its own booth at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference. It was an exciting project that I wouldn't want to miss. 😊 

Over the past months, we invested a lot of time into brainstorming ideas, making plans, and finally bringing our booth to life.
It was a rollercoaster ride with challenges that occasionally pushed me to my limits. But that's what made it so thrilling! We stuck together, found solutions, and in the end, created a booth we can be proud of.

DMEXCO 2023 was the most significant project during my internship at Douglas Marketing Solutions. It provided me with valuable experiences in B2B Online Marketing and helped me grow personally.

I want to express my sincere gratitude to my team and everyone who visited us at DMEXCO. You made this event truly special!

I look forward to the upcoming challenges and to participating in more exciting projects as Junior Marketing and Automation Manager at Douglas! 🤗

7104745518945169408,"Thanks Jonathan Mew for your Advice To My Younger Self. 

From Carlton to the position of CEO at the IAB and lots in between, it's been quite the journey. 

GingerMay #ATMYS
","Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

When Victoria Usher asked me to look back at my career so far as part of GingerMay ’s Advice to My Younger Self series, it was easy to point to moments when, in hindsight, I might have done something differently. 

Knowing what I know now, for example, would I have put all my redundancy money into an Icelandic bank in 2008 - with my wife only four weeks pregnant? Probably not (luckily I was reimbursed)!

When I started working, my goals were incredibly materialistic - to do marketing for Orange and own a BMW, and I achieved both inadvertently. I went from a research role to a marketing role at Carlton TV, then became a Marketing Manager at Freeserve, which went on to be part of Orange. And I owned a Mini - that was close enough.

Back in 2000, I was honestly sceptical about whether digital marketing would take off. Despite having opportunities to move into digital, I watched the first dot-com crash and felt unsure about the future of the internet. When I eventually took the plunge and moved to Freeserve, I realised I’d paused for too long. So, when mobile emerged as the new frontier, I wanted to be the first to understand it. I took the chance in 2008 to become Head of Mobile at IAB UK and focused on educating brands about the value of moving to mobile. 

My role at the IAB grew to encompass more areas of digital advertising and I was honoured to become CEO in 2017. Like any of these things, there was good fortune involved, but a big part of my career growth has stemmed from my willingness to champion emerging channels. Also, a big thank you to Dave McCall and Guy Phillipson for supporting me with achieving this goal. 

Here is the advice I’d give to my younger self - or anyone else at the start of their career:

- Don’t worry about making mistakes. When I first started out, the thing that stressed me the most was the idea of making a mistake. And early on I did make mistakes. But if you are surrounded by a supportive, understanding team, these mistakes become a vital part of your journey and help you grow into a stronger person.

- Understand your strengths and back yourself to succeed. One of the biggest hurdles I’ve had to overcome is believing in myself. As simple as it may seem, being able to understand your skill set, see where your strengths lie, and then apply yourself confidently is so important. Just as vital is seeing where your weaknesses are and how to improve. 

- You can’t do it on your own. No one gets anywhere without the help of others. When I started out, so much of my job was about building relationships - both with clients and my own team. To be truly effective in an organisation, people need to trust you and respect your opinion - and vice versa.

Since digital advertising never stands still, keeping up with the rapid shifts means having stable foundations. Hopefully these tips can help anyone to find their footing and set themselves on the course to success.",2023-09-05T08:42:11.489Z,no,no,"The post date is September 5, 2023, which is more than 12 months before the event date of September 18, 2024.

Today is World Cancer Day, and if you are someone who can relate to this topic, I urge you to find out more about how Shiseido can support you at our Life Quality Beauty Centres.

It was a step out of my comfort zone to take part in this, but it has been so rewarding learning to prepare, pitch and present one’s ideas, leaning in on others for alternative perspectives, and being inspired by all the other contestants to think about topics that I never would have in my daily work.

▶ LinkedIn is a professional networking platform that is used by millions of people around the world. By being visible on this platform, you can connect with other professionals in your industry and build your professional network.

▶ LinkedIn is a great way to showcase your personal professional brand and expertise. By regularly posting updates and engaging with other users, you can demonstrate your knowledge and skills to a wide audience.

Probably just an American thing, but a lot of youth groups & sports teams would sell these coupon books as fundraisers. You'd all get dragged into the gym for a training on how this book, for a mere $20, would give the buyer ""thousands"" of dollars in savings with local businesses.

7173828451315953664,"SXSW 2024 Musings

I attended SXSW for the 12th time this past Thurs-Mon and wanted to share some candid thoughts and opinions from the perspective of someone who has attended every year since 2011 (w/ the exception of 2 pandemic years).

- This was the most sprawling the conference has ever felt, with the usual Convention Center / Rainey St center of gravity expanding well into rapidly gentrifying East Austin, south towards the still new-ish Soho House, and in all directions to the many private and VIP events that no longer feel like they are in direct competition with badge programming. This reminds me of the mid-2010s transformation at Cannes, when the commercial activity surrounding the conference started to rival the conference itself. Same vibes at SX this year.

- Delta Air Lines “won” SXSW this year, hands down. Brand engagement started with the flight into Austin (complete w/ a welcoming committee at the terminal upon touchdown), they solved a legit pain point (providing a fast pass to access official badges), and their Lounge destination was the talk of the town. Shout out to Alicia Tillman for the vision and Team Epiphany for the execution. Pound for pound one of the best SXSW experiences of the past decade.

- Yahoo's brand comeback story continues, and their alignment with universally loved and immaculate vibe-purveyor Poolsuite sent such a strong signal to those in the know that they are serious about getting back on track. Tressie Lieberman and Marty Bell deserve props for throwing the best retro nostalgia-themed party on a competitive Sunday night.

- Conversations with fellow SX veterans revolved around how light the conference felt this year. Attendance numbers for Interactive have yet to be reported, but it felt like there were far fewer badge holders (a lot less chaos in the convention center), less junior and mid-level brand and agency attendees, and less foot traffic in general.

- Large scale brand activations that also did fan service to the general public also felt light, with Audible, LaCroix Water and Porsche AG providing some of the notable inclusive brand experiences for both industry nerds and locals to enjoy. The absence of music platform activations and the disappearance of music publication showcases made Interactive and Music feel siloed in a way that I've never felt before.

- That being said and given the seniority of operators in attendance, it did feel like a very strong year for counter programming, private activations, and VIP events. Some of the highlights that come to mind are Robb Report's House of Robb (incredible execution), Snap Inc. Sanctuary, The Female Quotient’s Equality Lounge, Brand Innovators, and a Tech For Good dinner by Greg Kahn with Ad Council, Northwell Health, and inKind to discuss how emerging tech can address pressing societal issues such as the gun violence epidemic.

I have a LOT more to share, but I'm running out of characters 🤷🏽♂️

So in short, is SXSW still worth attending? YES",,2024-03-13T23:53:06.049Z,no,no,"The post is about SXSW 2024, not DMEXCO 2024."

.
.
สิ่งสำคัญที่ทำให้ Content Creator อยากทำคอนเทนต์ต่อไปคือกำลังใจจากผู้ติดตาม แต่ Content Creator ทุกคนจะรู้ว่าสิ่งที่จะทำให้ไปต่อได้อย่างยั่งยืนจริงๆ คือต้องมีรายได้กลับเข้ามาบ้างไม่มากก็น้อย
.
ในบทความนี้ผมจะมาแชร์ 5 วิธีการหารายได้ผ่าน Social Media Platform อย่าง Blockdit โดยที่จะเรียงจากง่ายไปยากนะครับ
.
รับรองว่าคุณจะสามารถเริ่มต้นหารายได้จาก Blockdit ได้โดยใช้เวลาไม่นานครับ
.
เอาล่ะ ถ้าพร้อมแล้ว ไปเริ่มต้นดูอันที่ง่ายที่สุดกันก่อนเลย!
.
.
1. #AdsMonetization
.
วิธีแรกซึ่งเป็นวิธีใหม่ล่าสุดที่ Blockdit พึ่งสร้างขึ้นมามีชื่อว่า Ads Monetization หรืออธิบายเป็นภาษาไทยง่ายๆ ว่า คุณในฐานะผู้สร้างเนื้อหาบน Blockdit สามารถอนุญาตให้เพจอื่นแสดงโฆษณาบน Page ของ คุณได้ โดยที่คุณจะได้รับส่วนแบ่งค่าโฆษณาด้วย
.
หลักการเหมือนกับการที่คุณมี Website หรือ Youtube Channel และคุณเปิดใช้งาน Google Adsense เพื่อสร้างรายได้
.
ซึ่งใน Blockdit คุณสามารถ Control ได้ว่าคุณอยากจะให้โฆษณาขึ้นมาใน Page ของคุณรึเปล่า ถ้าไม่ต้องการ ก็สามารถไปปิดทิ้งได้
.
ยิ่ง Page ของคุณมีคนเข้ามาอ่านมาก ก็จะยิ่งมีคนเห็นโฆษณามาก และคุณก็จะได้รายได้มากข้ึนตามไปด้วย
.
วิธีนี้ถือเป็นวิธีที่เริ่มต้นได้ง่ายเพราะคุณแค่ต้องโฟกัสเรื่องการเขียนของคุณไป แล้วปล่อยให้ Blockdit จัดการเรื่องคนเข้ามาใช้พื้นที่ของคุณในการโฆษณาแทน
.
[[โฟกัส = ทำให้คนอยากเข้ามาอ่าน]]
.
Note: คุณจะเริ่มเปิดโฆษณาใน Blockdit ได้ก็ต่อเมื่อมีโพสต์ที่ได้ดาวเกิน 3 อัน
.
2. #Star & #Diamond (ดาวและเพชร)
.
ถ้าโพสต์จากเพจของคุณมีคนเข้ามาอ่านและมีคนเข้ามาปฏิสัมพันธ์มากเพียงพอภายในเวลา 48 ชั่วโมง คุณจะได้ Star (ดาว)
.
ถ้าคุณได้ดาวจากผู้อ่าน แสดงว่าคุณทำให้คนชื่นชอบ Blockdit และคุณทำให้คนใช้เวลาอยู่กับ Platform นานขึ้น ซึ่ง Blockdit จะให้รางวัลคุณด้วยเงินโบนัส
.
และถ้าโพสต์ของคุณเป็นที่ถูกใจของคนอ่าน คนอ่านสามารถให้ Diamond (เพชร) ซึ่งเพชรนั้นสามารถเปลี่ยนเป็นเงินได้เช่นกัน (ณ ปัจจุบัน เพชร 1 เม็ด = 0.33 บาท)
.
ซึ่งในความเห็นของผม ขั้นตอนการได้มาซึ่งดาวและเพชรนั้นมีอยู่ง่ายๆ 4 ขั้นตอนคือ
.
1. เลือกหัวข้อให้น่าสนใจ
2. ตั้งชื่อให้น่าดึงดูด
3. ส่งมอบคุณค่าผ่านเนื้อหา
4. เลือก Category ให้เหมาะสม
.
วิธีนี้จะมีความยากขึ้นมาอีกขั้นเพราะนอกจากจะทำให้คนอยากอ่านแล้ว ต้องทำให้คนอ่านแล้วชอบด้วย
.
[[โฟกัส = ทำให้คนเข้ามาอ่านแล้วชอบ]]
.
3. เปิด #PremiumPost
.
ถ้าคุณมั่นใจว่าเนื้อหาที่คุณกำลังจะเปิดเผยให้คนอ่านนั้นมีคุณค่าและมีคุณภาพมาก คุณสามารถเปิดเนื้อหานั้นๆ เป็น Premium Post เพื่อให้คนอ่าน/ดูคอนเทนต์ของคุณต้องจ่ายเพชร (Diamond) ก่อนจะเข้ามาอ่านได้
.
วิธีนี้จะต่างกับวิธีที่แล้วตรงที่ วิธีที่แล้วใช้ระบบ Donate คือคนอ่านแล้วชอบถึงค่อยให้เพชร แต่วิธีนี้คือใช้ระบบ Gated Content คือมั่นใจว่าเนื้อหาดีเลยทำการคิดราคาก่อนให้อ่าน
.
วิธีนี้ นอกจากจะทำให้คนอยากเข้ามาอ่านและทำให้คนชอบแล้ว ต้องทำให้คนเชื่อใจด้วยว่าคอนเทนต์จากคุณจะดีจริงๆ
.
[[โฟกัส = ต้องทำให้คนเชื่อใจ]]

The lazy, hazy days of summer are officially over. As the school bells ring and children return to their classrooms, the business world is also gearing up for a new season. Just as students swap flip-flops for trainers and backpacks, I’ve swapped my beach towel for a laptop and forecasting meetings!

September marks the end of the ""dog days of summer,"" but as the leaves begin to change colour and the temperature drops, for me there is a renewed sense of energy and purpose filling the air. 

Much like for those returning to school, the start of September brings with it a feeling of anticipation and excitement. September is a pivotal month in my business year.  We see a huge increase in events, trade shows, new marketing campaigns, the pressures to end the quarter strongly and for many the start to the frantic run up to the Q4 peak.  

For me, the lethargy of summer is all but a distant memory and the hyper active, hyper focused run into the end of the year has begun.  Last week I attended #SeamlessEurope where I joined a panel discussing the impact of predictive analytics on business and marketing execution.  This week we are hosting the Similarweb Annual Sales Leaders dinner in London where we will be discussing 'No nonsense AI: How Sales teams can use AI to create more value and less noise.  The team then moves quickly to #DMexco Cologne, SBC Summit Lisbon (#SBCEvents), and we are hosting what will be a fascinating webinar outlining Digital Cost Efficiency in Retail on Thursday 26th.

The dog days of summer may be behind us, but the best is yet to come.

 𝟭. 𝗔𝗜 𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲.
Keine große Überraschung, dass KI eine große Rolle bei Vorträgen und Ausstellern spielt – aber es gab frische Impulse! Besonders beeindruckt hat mich Fork Unstable Media‘s kreative Neuinterpretation von KI-generierten Logos. 
Weg von statischen Grafiken hin zu organischen, lebendigen Formen, die im Branding eine ganz neue emotionale Dimension eröffnen, indem sie die Schlüsselemotionen der Brand auch in Motion packen. Beispiel: Wenn ich als Marke für „Sicherheit“ stehe, kann sich meine Form in immer neue Formen wandeln, die subtil oder deutlich „Sicherheit“ implizieren. Ganz fantastisch!  🚀

 𝟮. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻, 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝗰𝗵 𝗺𝗲𝗵𝗿 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻!
Dass Marketing datengetrieben ist, ist klar. Aber Salesforce hat in ihrem spannenden Vortrag deutlich gezeigt, wie zukunftsweisend Email-Marketing mit den richtigen Kundendaten sein kann. Ihr KI-getriebenes Tool ermöglicht hyperpersonalisierte E-Mails – das Beispiel eines fiktiven Kunden hat die Möglichkeiten beeindruckend verdeutlicht. 📊 ✉️

 𝟯. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗸𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀-𝗣𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀!
Leider waren nicht alle Vorträge ein Volltreffer. Wenn der Inhalt zu 100% aus Eigenwerbung besteht, geht der Mehrwert verloren. Bei mir erreichen die Unternehmen so genau das Gegenteil – es hinterlässt einen faden Beigeschmack.  🤔
 
⬇️ Wie stehst du zu Punkt 3? Ist Vortrag = Salespitch eine „Best Practice“?
PS: aus der Metaperspektive noch eine Frage, die mich beschäftigt hat: Wie sieht die Zukunft der Messe aus?

Nachdem wir in diesem Jahr schon zum zweiten Mal auf der #OMR vertreten waren, sind wir vom 18. bis 19. September 2024 zum ersten Mal mit einem eigenen Stand auf der #DMEXCO in Köln am Start.

Ich muss zugeben, dass die DMEXCO in den letzten Jahren in meiner Wahrnehmung häufig hinter dem Tamtam der OMR zurück geblieben ist. Dabei passt die DMEXCO eigentlich viel besser zu inboundfriends und unseren Kunden.

Das hat vor allem drei Gründe:

💯 B2B statt B2C: Bei inboundfriends sind wir zu 100% auf B2B-Unternehmen spezialisiert. Damit passen wir super auf die DMEXCO, die einen stärkeren B2B-Fokus hat als die B2C-orientierte OMR.

🛠️ Tool-Expertise: Als Experten für CRM- und Marketing-Tools finden wir auf der DMEXCO wahrscheinlich mehr interessante Kontakte und potenzielle Kunden als auf der OMR. Viele namhafte Tool-Anbieter, wie @HubSpot, sind auf der DMEXCO sogar mit einem eigenen Stand vertreten.

🎉 Weniger Party, mehr Substanz: Wir konzentrieren uns als Agentur auf erklärungsbedürftige Produkte und Services. Ich hoffe, dass die DMEXCO mehr Raum für tiefgehende Gespräche zu komplexen Lösungen bietet als die OMR mit ihrem Party-Spektakel. Auch wenn ich meine Erinnerungen an unsere legendäre Standparty nicht missen möchte 😉

Mentoring other entrepreneurs is a chance to share your hard-won wisdom and help them avoid common pitfalls. Plus, it's a great way to grow your own network and leadership skills. Best of all, you get to give back to the entrepreneurial community and contribute to the success of others.

The momentum continues this week as our team attends events globally.

- 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭: A noticeable shift towards sustainable, plant-based, and functional foods was evident, as more consumers are looking for health conscious options. The integration of technology and transparency in sourcing were major themes that are likely to define future product development.

✅ Valuations of assets
✅ Created an ethical and governance framework
✅ Implemented an integrated strategy to ensure internal collaboration

✅ Created commercial assets
✅ Executed a robust brand targeting strategy
✅ Outreach and cultivation +250 brands

✅ Sold to Aviva: 1 x Naming rights partner. 1x Skills and Training 1 x Sustainability partnership.
 
These types of partnerships are complex and challenging therefore having a clear process is key to success.

Please follow the OMClub page here and on your social network of choice for all updates, ticket-giveaways and more!

Some history: I launched OMClub in 2008, after exiting gulli.com and my ‘gulli wars’ exit/birthday/book-launch party escalated so nicely, that Vodafone offered some sponsoring money to improve the sad state of dmexco after-parties. Over the last 10 years OMClub turned into THE party to be at the first evening of dmexco, that no one in the online / performance marketing industry wants to miss with more than 3000 party-people and a budget of more than 300.000 EUR for a single night!
Motivation and OMClub itself is best explained through the words of Dan Taylor, the legendary house photographer of many global startup events (SXSW, Techcrunch disrupt, Bits & Pretzels, NOAH, …) who’s got the authority to compare and wrote the following about OMClub:
https://lnkd.in/gQpr2GQS
“A conference without a killer party is like pancakes without the maple syrup. Like gin without the tonic. Like rock without the roll. In other words, no conference is complete without one. And to a good end … As I always remind clients, “No deals were ever forged in the main speaking hall. They begin with an intro, with a drink, with a “Have you met … Ted?””
Having said all that, there are parties, and then there’s the OMClub party that the folks from Pirate Summit host on the night before the opening of DMEXCO in Cologne, Germany. … Now, I’m not going to tell you that the OMClub party is the best one I’ve ever been too, because it’s not. But it IS the best business related party I’ve ever seen.“
It was my ex Scarlett and me, who planned OMClub for ca. 200 people, but suddenly got dozens of friends to sponsor more money (some of them paying cash to not affect their earn-out-multiples) and having to close doors after 1000 arrived, witnessing the birth of a legend – and the rest is history! Organizing this party showed me, that I enjoyed getting people drunk much more than working in the online industry and made me start Beerhouse! There’s literally thousands of people to thank! Instead of getting upset at me for not mentioning you, please just add your own crazy memory in the comments below!
Many people and teams changed, but I managed to top the previous year’s party every year, presenting bumper-cars (Autoscooter), bungee jumping towers and finally making my dream of a full go-cart track come true in 2017. As I relocated to South Africa and started building Beerhouse (on Long) I found Jane Mull who helped me pull off several OMClubs until moving back to Germany and so I started looking for new permanent ‘parents’ for my baby, which I found in my playmate from kindergarten times Manuel Koelman 🏴☠️ and his PIRATE Team

Why?

Microsoft está llevando su tecnología publicitaria al siguiente nivel con las últimas actualizaciones de Copilot AI, un avance significativo en la personalización de anuncios y la creación de experiencias publicitarias interactivas. Estas nuevas funciones permiten a las marcas no solo optimizar sus campañas, sino también crear contenido más relevante y ajustado a las preferencias individuales de cada usuario.

Gracias a la integración de inteligencia artificial más avanzada, los anunciantes ahora tienen la capacidad de generar experiencias que capturan la atención y generan mejores resultados en todas las plataformas digitales. Copilot AI facilita el diseño de anuncios más inteligentes y efectivos, al tiempo que ofrece una mayor flexibilidad en la ejecución de estrategias publicitarias.

Principales beneficios:
Personalización a gran escala: Las marcas pueden ajustar sus anuncios en tiempo real según las interacciones del usuario, maximizando la relevancia.
Optimización continua: La IA aprende y adapta los anuncios automáticamente, mejorando el rendimiento sin intervención manual.
Interactividad mejorada: Los usuarios pueden participar en experiencias más dinámicas, lo que incrementa el engagement y las conversiones.
Con estas mejoras, Microsoft reafirma su compromiso con la transformación digital de la publicidad, ofreciendo herramientas potentes que facilitan la conexión con las audiencias y permiten a los anunciantes destacar en un mercado cada vez más competitivo.

¿Su marca está preparada para aprovechar al máximo la inteligencia artificial en la publicidad? El futuro de la publicidad digital ya está aquí, y Copilot AI es una pieza clave de esta evolución.

I want to say ""thank you"" for all the great talks, meetings, and new- and re-connections.

Here is my personal review:
⚫ Fewer people, but much better talks
⚫ For the first time in a long while, the event couldn't hide the global topics. Economic and geopolitical challenges are affecting the business of many players.
⚫ Some problems remain the same (parking attendants are as disorganized as always, the mobile ticket still produces a paper badge, the wifi is unstable, and mobile data is still a challenge)
⚫ Additionally, some topics have remained the same for years (requests for standards in different areas that still don't exist, advice on how to do certain things from players who haven't accomplished anything)
⚫ There are still eye-catching booths and attractions (like a hairdresser).
There were fewer international visitors
⚫ Sustainability should be the norm but is still only a side topic and not a mindset (starting with no buses to the airport)

Overall, I liked the new concept and hope that 2024 will follow a similar direction. The digital economy needs fairs where you can get an overview and do business at the same time, rather than just newer events that increasingly feel like festivals

It was a real pleasure talking with Karine Fouque from La French Tech On Air about how Sendinblue made it to first place in Europe. 

Crossing the Rhine by acquiring Newsletter2Go and putting a solid M&A strategy in place was for sure an important part of the success.

Listen to our lessons learned about internationalization, becoming Europe’s #1 and M&A. 

Link to the full episode in the comments. 

#tech #strategy #europe","🚨 New episode: Build the digital marketing leader in Europe with Sendinblue - La French Tech on Air #3

If you want to #scale in #Europe, you have to be present in #France and #Germany, and make the leap to cross the Rhin, usually after a significant #fundraising round. 

One way to achieve this goal is to acquire your main competitor in the local country with an #M&A to gain quicker #marketshares, join forces for developing innovative new features and accelerate expansion into other international markets. 

This was the strategy of Sendinblue acquiring Newsletter2go in 2019 to build the digital marketing leader in Europe. 

In this episode, Karine Fouque, president of La French Tech Munich, and Maximilian Modl, current CEO of Sendinblue Germany  since 2019, and co-founder of #Newsletter2go back in 2013, discussed the “#behindthescenes” of this #expansion #growth #go2market journey, from a #strategic and #operational level, in the run to create #europeanchampions

7170934419761811457,"Siempre habrá un antes y después de la pandemia y en el mundo de la publicidad no es ajeno a ello, miremos el informe que nos traen a AAM:

✅ La publicidad digital paso de $142 en el 2019 a $205 millones en el 2023 (+63 M) +45% de crecimiento

✅ La TV abierta paso de $207 en el 2019 a $175 millones en el 2023 (-32 M)  -16% de decrecimiento

✅ La Vía publica, radio y TV cable igualmente decreciendo entre -33%,-16%-11% respectivamente.

Ni que decir con los diarios, cine y revistas casi por desaparecer.

Todo esto me lleva a la conclusión de que, sin lugar a dudas, si no tienes contemplado un presupuesto para publicidad en tu estrategia digital, te estás quedando rezagado en comparación con la competencia que sí lo está implementando.

Si aún no estás familiarizado con las plataformas de publicidad (Ads) que puedes utilizar y cómo una inversión mínima puede generar una cantidad significativa de leads, no dudes en ponerte en contacto conmigo. Estaré encantado de ayudarte.

7041168819855241216,"Twitter & bank apps for digital bank runs?

SVB is the second biggest US bank failure. 

Biggest one was Washington Mutual in 2008.

But let's look at the dynamics here:

💸 WaMu bank run took 10 days, for depositors to withdraw $17 billion.

Triggered by the Lehman Brothers collapse.


💸  SVB? It took SVB depositors 24 hours to withdraw $42 billion.

After a badly executed management report.


💡A 20-30 times faster bank run than 15 yrs ago!


Without going into macro, T-bills interest rates, bad risk management etc etc, most analyses say that SVB didn't have grave solvency issues.

Yet they caused the biggest post-2008 financial turmoil.

Two things seem to be critical here:


1️⃣ Social media i.e. virality

2️⃣ Mobile banking i.e. transaction speed


📢 Social Media

Story goes that much of it happened in Bay Area founders Telegram groups. Some of those groups have 200+ members!

It's Thursday morning, Telegram is buzzing like mad. It's late AM and Bay Area founders got their money out.

But it gets worse.

It started spreading on Twitter like a wildfire 🔥

Getting us to...


📱 Mobile banking:

In 2008 one had to go to the bank, make calls, do papers.

In 2023 one makes a transfer with couple of taps or clicks. 


💡 It takes 5 minutes to read a Tweet and make a transfer. All on the same device.


It's just crazy how volatile things are.

We listened to customers on both sides: those rated by EcoVadis and those requesting ESG evaluations of their trading partners. It was an energizing event, one that allowed us to exchange ideas, bows and above all, discuss how we can collectively work together to accelerate impact. A big thank you to everyone involved ! どうもありがとう

It was a refreshing in person exchange on best practices, based on our customers' experiences, including opportunities for better supplier engagement, improving trading partner's scores and even a panel with suppliers highlighting their expectations and challenges. We also unveiled new EcoVadis functionalities and features that allow companies to further deployment of their strategies.

It was a special event one that was excellently managed from conception to completion by our very own Mahoko Yoshimoto. An important milestone as it was our first in person World Tour event in the Asia Pacific Japan region. Plenty of interesting discussions during the event and at our special networking event after the show. I am looking forward to doing more with our partners and customers. 

Thank you Tokyo for always being so welcoming and sparking many conversations and new ideas.

Interested in doing more with EcoVadis? Please message me if so and I will put you in touch with the right person.

📉 Fewer booth participants this year, reflecting tough times in ecommerce and related software sectors. Companies with a booth there this year seen by participants as financially robust and stable.

🛒 Retailers are now media platforms. Lidl, Kaufland, Rewe, Douglas, Rossmann, and even Obi showcased their ad platforms. Obvious one, but still interesting to see Obi have a booth at DMEXCO for its media/ ads platform.

I've always thought (but struggled to respect it) that you need to stay at least three years in a role to have an impact. In one of my previous assignments, I even went as far as to commit publicly to it because I felt the team was tired of so many leadership changes.

Alright, so the three years thing probably holds true for business but there is one element where you don't need to wait three years: PEOPLE. Or at least that's the way the CTS Finance team made me feel ❤😭 during my last townhall. I was deeply touched by the messages I heard and I wish all of you to experience this feeling at least once in your career.

A bit like ASDA, Waititi + the Bubes, we’ve got an array of surprises that you’re sure to love lined-up for MAD//Fest London 2024 (2-4 July), including a super cool expanded festival site so we can accommodate more brand attendees, more topical content streams + more opportunities for you to dine, delight or even dance with the clients on your hit list!

 

I’d love to give you a heads up on our plans to take the UK’s largest festival for brands + agencies to the next level + explore imaginative, effective + distinctive ways to immerse your clients in what you do.

 

Many players like Channel Factory are now firming up their plans for killer activations at MAD//Fest that turn the dial on new business. Better still, they’re getting it for a ‘smart price’ that includes preferential rates until Dec + extra tickets + content. We’ve also just experienced our strongest ever re-book, meaning top locations are already being locked in.

7084916245170450433,"For promotions nerds like me, Amazon Prime Day is pretty exciting.

Here are a couple of takeaways so far: 

🎯 Lots of personalization attempts (and I’ve read mostly good reviews of their personalization progress this year), but mine are still wildly off the mark. My top recommendations today? A carseat, and a pair of women's beach shoes. I am a childless, carless man in a landlocked city. ""WOW Offers"" indeed 😂 Anyone else?

✉️ The invitation-only offers are quite clever. Here's the deal: you have to express intent to even be ""invited"" to get an offer. It seems to just be a superficial thing (I got invited to all the deals I tried), but I love the idea that a user has to actually say ""Yeah, I want this offer!"" to get the deal. This builds a brilliant sense of exclusivity / scarcity for the offers. VERY smart.

🥴 Search & navigation on this site just get worse & worse. I scroll past a ton of junk to find the ""Kitchen"" offers, click ""Kitchen,"" then have to scroll past 6 rows of vacuum cleaners...

So in short, some smart new promotions tactics, but mostly more examples of Amazon's ensh*ttification & ""Day 2"" culture. Quite a different business from the Amazon of the past, with pretty run-of-the-mill prices and fulfillment and soooo much junk!

I can't stop thinking about how Victor Castro described Amazon on Rick Watson's podcast this week from a brand perspective: 

“It’s an overcrowded, really busy shopping mall with a ton of traffic. But I’m really not interested in paying rent at this mall. I am happy to stand at the door with a flier about my product, but don't want to pay rent for a store.""

Overall, clicking around the Prime Day offers has built my optimism that retailers have a fighting chance to claw more and more revenue back from Amazon. I really think these issues (bad experience, bad quality) are foundational and have totally eclipsed the company’s once legendary customer centricity & ability to innovate.

Would love to hear your notes on Prime Day. Just after I get back from driving my non-existent child in my non-existent car for a swim at our non-existent local beach.

The energy and conversations aren't shying away from great topics, and it's been extremely exciting to have the opportunity to be on the ground as we showcase our first case with Scope3. A huge thank you to Brian O'Kelley and Scope3 for the fantastic presentation. To be the world's first DSP to bring sustainable supply chain tools to market and put them in the hands of our clients is a huge step and I love opportunities like this to represent Adform while working with partners to be at the cutting edge of industry innovation. Thank you to Stephan Loerke and the full team at WFA for the opportunity to join in and listen to the topics currently at the forefront of Advertiser's priorities. ","We're proud to release our first case study demonstrating how you can run effective campaigns while lowering your carbon footprint.

6976199228804997120,"What is the future of language in the #metaverse?

At the amazing #digitalx conference I learned 2 different perspectives on it:
💡I was able to create within seconds a video of me speaking Chinese 😮 or of my #avatar to speak with anyone in any language in the metaverse with the help of the software of D-ID 
💡The CEO of the most successful language learning app Babbel, Arne Schepker, held a keynote about how Babbel includes human interaction like real human courses and human speakers into their app, because language and conversation is about human emotions and connections which cannot be replaced by tech

My belief is that transactional conversations will become automated, but the beauty of learning languages to really dive into a different culture will remain. 

What do you think? Will we be learning foreign languages in the future?

7258088823924928512,"𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐄-𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞 – 𝟓 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬

Chinese #eCommerce is evolving rapidly. Unlike in the West Chinese platforms focus on creating engaging experiences. Björn Ognibeni’s recent workshop highlighted key strategies Western e-commerce could adopt to stay competitive as giants like #Shein, #Temu, and #Alibaba claim global market share.

Five lessons:

🛍️ 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲-𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠
Chinese platforms transform shopping into an adventure. Instead of bland product lists, they use discovery feeds inspired by TikTok and Instagram, where products are part of the content experience. Remember flipping through an IKEA catalog? Today’s digital version uses visually engaging, scrollable designs with video content and live shopping, making online shopping a time-killer that could seriously compete with Netflix.

🛍️ 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬
Typical product pages often look functional but uninspiring. Chinese sites take a different approach with interactive features, videos, 360-degree views, and integrated user reviews. This makes the experience immersive and boosts engagement, increasing the likelihood of purchase.

🛍️ 𝐕𝐢𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐨-𝐏𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞
In China, shopping blends seamlessly between online and offline. For younger consumers, the ""real"" world includes both digital and physical experiences. Chinese platforms let users explore products online, try them in-store, or experience them through augmented reality. Western retailers could benefit by enabling customers to test products virtually or even immerse themselves in digital worlds. Platforms like Roblox could become the next big shopping destination.

🛍️ 𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐄-𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞
In China, e-commerce is a social event, with chat functions and group video calls allowing friends to shop together. Integrating similar social features could foster real-time engagement on Western platforms. Customers could share reviews, discuss trends, and exchange recommendations, creating a community-driven experience that builds customer loyalty and keeps users engaged longer.

🛍️ 𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝐊𝐏𝐈𝐬: 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐬 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜
While the West focuses heavily on performance metrics, China emphasizes quality customer relationships. KPIs like browsing time and engagement encourage a richer shopping experience, leading to stronger bonds with customers. Instead of paying per click, retailers can establish lasting customer relationships that are often more sustainable and cost-effective.

I am convinced that the retailers who come up with completely new shopping concepts first have a great chance of capturing significant market shares.

At DIGITAL X, we in the audience were in for a treat when Sefa Soybir , Frauke Stotz  and Ralph Rotzler from Deutsche Bundesbank discussed what to do about the cash-focus in German society. A topic close to my heart after living in Norway for 6 years while only using cash 5 times or so. 

Moreover, I learned more about the power of AI-powered chatbots from a forerunner in the field: Cognigy , presenting together with DHL and Telekom MMS. Keep your eyes peeled, this bot will go live soon! It took them  just 4 months from kick-off to launch!

The Expo was declared open by the MD/CEO of NDDC, Dr. Samuel Ogbuku. Dr. Maurice Dawson Jr., Ph.D. the Director, Center for Cybersecurity and Forensic Education (C2SAFE) of the Illinois Institute of Technology delivered the Keynote. 

Yours truly had the honour of delivering the keynote for the Cybersecurity session. My keynote was titled: Emerging Threats and Countermeasures: Building Resilience in Nigeria’s Rapidly Evolving Threat Landscape. 

The 3-day event had sessions in Cybersecurity, AgriTech, MedTech, EdTech, Energy Tech, AI, among others. The event also featured a Hackathon and Pitch event. 

It was good to network and meet IT professionals and tech enthusiasts. I was particularly pleased that I met young people who passionately participated in all the sessions. 

See you on the 24th April 2025, for the next edition.

Sulla scia della prima parte del nostro sondaggio sul linguaggio #inclusivo e dato l’interesse suscitato da quest’ultimo, rieccoci qua con un secondo post su questa tematica tanto attuale quanto controversa.

Questa volta facciamo affidamento sulle vostre capacità analitiche e intuitive e vi spingiamo ad andare oltre il mero messaggio verbale, ovvero lo slogan estrapolato dal contesto visivo. Le opzioni che vi proponiamo giocano sull’equilibrio sottile di un doppio livello comunicativo: quello linguistico da un lato e quello paralinguistico dall’altro. Rappresentano le due facce della stessa medaglia alle quali tutti i #brand si affidano da sempre per rendere un messaggio commerciale accattivante, convincente e al contempo ricco di contenuti non verbali, in grado di far leva sulle emozioni più profonde deɜ consumatorɜ. Nel panorama della lingua “ampia”, tali elementi rivestono un ruolo cruciale nell’affinare la sensibilità del pubblico su tematiche sempre meno discriminatorie nei confronti di determinate categorie di persone.

Questa volta abbiamo trovato interessante portare alla vostra attenzione quattro campagne pubblicitarie di larghissima diffusione in Italia, tutte in qualche modo entrate nel patrimonio nazionalpopolare fatto di immagini, certezze radicate e luoghi comuni, che, data la loro familiarità, tendiamo a 𝐧𝐨𝐧 mettere in discussione. O almeno non nel modo in cui dovremmo. Le quattro campagne si collocano in un arco di tempo che va dal 1974 al 2016, e rientrano dunque nel “repertorio iconografico culturale” di tuttɜ ɜ utentɜ natɜ a cavallo tra gli anni Settanta e la Generazione X.
Tra queste, soltanto una trasmette un messaggio davvero ampio e non discriminante su tutta la linea, tanto dal punto di vista linguistico quanto da quello visivo. Le altre tre risultano, per un motivo o per un altro, non inclusive o persino fortemente discriminanti.

Buona visione e buona lettura, siamo certɜ che saprete fornirci anche stavolta dei validi spunti di riflessione e dell’ottimo materiale per continuare più consapevolɜ il nostro viaggio.

During the episode Kya shares her personal journey, starting with her studying international business at the University of Arkansas and eventually moving to her unexpected but rewarding career in technology. 

Kya also discusses the rapidly changing landscape of advertising and how Microsoft is driving innovation in this space. She highlights the diverse range of products and platforms that Microsoft offers for advertising, including MSN, Bing, Outlook, Xbox, and Skype. She also shares how Microsoft Advertising works closely with advertisers, agencies, and publishers to find audiences within the Microsoft ecosystem and extend their reach across the web.

7113948148598759424,,"Reemplazar a un mal jefe es más barato que a todo su equipo 🤔

Una gran mayoría de personas dice renunciar a sus puestos de trabajo por tener un mal responsable directo.

Es decir, por tener un mal jefe, un mismo trabajador puede fracasar en una organización, pero triunfar en otra.

Sus conocimientos, habilidades y experiencia no han cambiado, pero sus resultados serán muy diferentes dependiendo del entorno que la empresa sea capaz de generar.

👉 Identificar y despedir a los líderes que generan fricciones entre la cultura de la empresa y su forma de liderar, fortalece el sentimiento de pertenencia y la cohesión del resto de la plantilla.

Let 's go!

- The event was packed with incredible minds in the industry, and I’m excited to explore potential collaborations. 
- Tampa is really hot, and humid even in the fall, not unlike Buenos Aires in February, so I felt a little at home.
- I had some insightful conversations about how we, at Schub, are the driving force for the evolution of our partners by focusing on delivering value and leveraging cloud technologies efficiently. Because we see ourselves as a partner that companies can rely on to innovate. 
- Attending these kinds of events is like training for a marathon, the steps you get are real!
- The discussions around tech and the future of the cloud were eye-opening. It’s fascinating how fast this space is evolving. 
- The energy from connecting with others face-to-face after so many virtual interactions is unmatched. It reminds me how essential these moments are for growth and innovation.

So beyond the weather (seriously, the heat is no joke), MES Fall 2024 has been full of valuable insights.

We have new #omnichannel tools available for people who want to connect CTV and all devices in the household... I learned offhand that we significantly reduced our compute carbon footprint by 75% (!)... and I'm very excited about our new algorithm. 

It's truly an exciting time in the industry. I found this quote by Rasmus Giese inspiring -- ""... the digital advertising industry can’t afford to just lie back, because everything is pointing to third-party cookies continuing to lose their relevance. Already, a significant proportion of users can no longer be addressed via third-party cookies. For example, the cookies are now blocked in the Safari and Firefox browsers. As for Chrome, it will depend on how Google asks users to opt in to ads. At the same time, mobile traffic is increasing in the apps – and that works without third-party cookies..."" 

Third-party cookies going away is a big deal of course, but as Wev Castro points out, a lot of our recent customers don't even come to us for 3P cookie-based retargeting. They are ready to move beyond it. Well, so are we of course, that is why we have trained a new algorithm that works without or with third-party cookies, uses 1st party cookies, extended IDs, and other new signals. We even added contextual signals to the identity graph! That is what is on my mind. Let's talk about enlarging your addressable audience. Let's talk about connecting the dots between disparate signals and activating your omnichannel campaigns. See you at DMEXCO.

Der Creativity Summit auf der DMEXCO

Seit unserem Brainstorming Ende 2023 war Anke und Matthias begeistert von der Idee eines Summits, der sich ausschließlich der Kreativität in der Digitalbranche widmet. DMEXCO hat sich stets entlang der gesamten Wertschöpfungskette der Digital-Marketing-Industrie entwickelt, aber echte, durchdringende Kreativität war oft nur ein Nebenschauplatz. Heute, auch angesichts der durch KI ausgelösten Dynamiken, wird die Bedeutung von authentischer, einzigartiger Kreativität in Kampagnen und Markenaktivitäten immer klarer. Sie muss sich wie ein roter Faden durchziehen, sonst wird sie in der Flut der Inhalte untergehen.

Es ist großartig zu sehen, wie dieser erste Schritt zusammen mit Branchenführern gelungen ist. Wir sind gespannt, wohin uns diese Reise bis 2025 führen wird!

📅 Merkt euch den 19. September 2024 vor und seid ab 10 Uhr auf der Agencies Stage in Halle 8 dabei.

Last week I shared the first 5 of Greg Topalian’s 10 year/10 predictions for our industry. 

Greg shared these during his session at The Exhibitions and Conventions Executive Forum in DC.

Here’s the final 5:

6️⃣ 40/60% of trade show revenues will come from attendees.
- There are/will be new ways to charge and increase revenues if you focus on the attendees and the experiences they want and will pay for. 
- Balance revenues out and stop the overreliance on sponsorships.

7️⃣ Attendees want meetings but are telling us “I don’t want to meet the people you want me to meet with. I want to choose, not you”. 
- Ask attendees who they want to meet.
- Then make sure they meet.

8️⃣ It’s far too easy to keep charging exhibitors a bit more than to try and solve the BIG problems (like unlocking the meetings issue). 
- Squeezing revenues from exhibitors has gotten old and limiting so stop focusing on that.
- Sort out your big issues which would fix revenues for the long term.

9️⃣ Your industry isn't that special. Lots of event execs say, “My industry wouldn’t like that,” but even accountants have human interests, like sports, music, etc. 
- Remember your industry is made up of real people, not job titles. 
- No matter what someone does for a job - don’t stereotype the kind of experience they might like because of their (supposedly boring) job title. 

🔟 Organisers will ask themselves, “Can I really create the experience I want in a traditional exhibition venue?” The answer may well be “no.” 
- We’ll see more events running in unusual venues, which allow them to deliver richer experiences.

Anything to add?

7075837082727796737,"People need to talk about good things. #volunteering

This week I visited 7 schools in Telšiai and Varniai (Western Lithuania) and met about 370 kids/teens.👩👩👦👦

What did I do and how did I get there?

A few months ago, me and my other female colleagues were invited to participate in the volunteering program called “Empowering Girls” created by two big organisations “Women Go Tech” & “Junior Achievement Lithuania”. When I heard about ir, I thought why not? I was always interested in the volunteering and I have been doing it for already three years (at #bigbrothersbigsisters).

So more about the program: the main goal was to share your personal story about the career in the tech industry and how it all started with the idea to encourage children’s/teens’ interest of considering to do the same. 

I knew it will be tough - kids (not even talking about teens) don’t like any official talks or someone telling them what or how to do, so I knew, I need to prepare to meet disinterested folks. Still, I found it important, and wanted to try doing it. What I really wanted was to find at least one person who will find it interesting or helpful, and who will take some of my advices. I knew it will give me some nice feeling or maybe some lesson too. 

I swear, I was sweating in front of the audience 😰, but with every school less and less.

And it all went more or less fine. Of course, I was having some difficult moments to include them to participate into the discussions, answer questions or make some of them  just listening to what I am trying to say. 
But the old good tricks - small rewards in the shape of candy 🍭 - always help to break the ice 🙃

What surprised me most during those presentations? 

That the boys were more active. The program calls “Empowering Girls” and, initially, it was created for the girls, but after a while, it was admitted - the stereotypes are in everyone’s head, and everyone is welcome in the discussion. Thus, I was positively overwhelmed that some kids in the 8th grade (let’s say around 14-15y.o.) already had the exact plan what they are going to do after finishing the school🥲🫶 

So all in all, despite the hectic time schedule, running around, trying to handle my work and all those presentations at the same time, it was definitely worth it. I had the opportunity to visit my old schools, to see the teachers that I admire until today, to see how the schools changed in all those years, got smaller in my perspective, but, also, in the number of students. And of course, the most important thing, I spotted some kids, who were carefully listening to every word I said and were nodding their heads. I really appreciate everyone who shared their dreams and future plans, who asked me to connect on Facebook❤️

Sorry, if the message got too long or sounds emotional, but that’s what volunteering means to me. 

I hope it will reach someone, who always wanted to start volunteering but never did it, and this time will give it a try. 💪",,2023-06-17T14:10:23.196Z,no,no,"The post date is 2023-06-17, which is more than 12 months before the event date of DMEXCO 2024 (September 18, 2024).

7175665003633549312,"Just back from Modex 2024 in Atlanta, USA, and wow, it was an incredible experience! Taking the time to attend this event has left me both glad and fulfilled. 🌟

Modex brought together a melting pot of supply chain professionals, technologists, and innovators from across the globe, offering a rare glimpse into the diverse solutions and products shaping our industry. Here are some personal key takeaways that really stood out to me:

**Global Solutions to Local Problems: Many of the challenges we face locally have already been addressed by the West, offering relatable case studies and insights that are directly applicable to our work.

**Beyond Innovation: The adoption of cutting-edge warehouse automation technologies like ASRS, AMRs, and AGVs isn't just about an innovative mindset. Factors like labor and storage costs, along with labor shortages, are pushing the industry towards these solutions at an accelerated pace.

**Software Reigns Supreme: The backbone of successful hardware turnkey projects is highly flexible, reliable, and scalable software technology. It's clear that in the realm of supply chain solutions, software still wears the crown.

 **Top-tier Talks: The quality of the presentations at Modex was unparalleled. It was a privilege to hear from professionals who have not only devised but also implemented groundbreaking solutions, offering clear and insightful articulations of their work.

 **AI’s Untapped Potential: The exploration of AI in supply chain management is still in its infancy, presenting a vast field of opportunity for innovation and application.

**A Call to Action for SMEs: The current landscape of supply chain technology often overlooks SMEs due to cost barriers, highlighting a significant opportunity for India to develop cost-effective solutions tailored to their needs.

Attending Modex 2024 was an insightful journey that has broadened my perspective and fueled my excitement for the future of supply chain innovation. The convergence of diverse ideas and solutions at this event was truly inspiring, underscoring the dynamic nature of our industry. Can't wait to see how we can apply these learnings to make a tangible impact!

Let's rock the marketing world together! #digitalmarketing #onlinemarketing #analytics #cookieless,"Many online marketers wonder how to track their page visitors correctly and under privacy legislation. 🤔

In the last few years, privacy legislation such as #GDPR and #ePrivacy has forced marketing managers to adapt how they practice online marketing. A lot has happened since then, both technically and legally. Now it's more than just a cookie 🍪 or other identifiers.

It meant it was time to find natively privacy-focused analytics solutions. And finding such a tool for our clients and us became one of our main tasks.
We explored a couple of solutions, but the one that impressed us the most was fusedeck®. A tool that is built with user privacy in place but that will still inspire and empower marketers to understand, analyze and improve their online marketing practices. 💡

❗That's why we're happy to announce that we joined their partner program to empower data-driven marketers while keeping them compliant with current and future privacy legislation.❗

7251944519032565760,"I had an amazing time speaking at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference last month on my favorite subject: data privacy. Specifically, I explained why this industry evolution is much more important than just cookies - it’s about data privacy.

It’s about moving to an ecosystem that removes the needless requirement to share, centralize, and commingle vast amounts of customer data. It’s about finally moving on from an industry built on slow and unsafe data practices to one built on secure data collaboration and collective responsibility. 

However, to get there, we must address the growing issue of privacy washing. Terms like ""privacy-first,"" ""privacy-safe,"" and ""privacy-centric"" are being thrown around far too easily, often with little substance behind the claims, causing confusion.

Privacy is not something that can be solved by slapping a label on a solution. It should be built in from the ground up. Data collaboration platforms, as I explain in this clip, should be privacy by default, anything less and it is not truly private nor secure. 

When done right, data collaboration should empower you to maximize both privacy and performance. Check out the full video where I explain strategies for avoiding privacy washing and how InfoSum is proving privacy and performance go hand-in-hand: https://hubs.la/Q02TgnBy0

- MiCAR creates a single European market for crypto assets with 448 million citizens and a GDP of 16.97 trillion euros. This is the biggest single regulated market for crypto globally
- The short-term potential of retail crypto offerings is particularly significant. 13% of Germans aged 18-64 are already invested in crypto. In comparison, only 20% are invested in shares and ETFs. 
- The long-term potential is even bigger - it's about the tokennization of all types of digital ownership and financial instruments. KPMG forecasts the market for tokenised financial instruments in Europe at 330 billion euros in 2030

If you want to learn more about MiCAR and its potential, read our whitepaper and take the KPMG MiCAR Pulse Check. A simple tool that quickly tells you how your business model is regulated and what requirements apply (link in the comments).

Other speakers discussed the potential of programmable money, web3 and token-based economies. Thank you w3.group, Vicktoria Klich, Jonathan Kuhl, Marvin Hug and Philipp Kielholz for the excellent organisation.

Fascinating insights, sage advice and a few choice words to an obnoxious lawyer. 

Thank you for all you continue to do for females in our industry.

GingerMay #ATMYS Mary Keane-Dawson","In life, fortunes twist and turn. Where I’ve arrived was very different from where I started. 
By the time I was ready for my first media job, I had had a baby and was desperate to earn money so I could get out of my council flat. I was 22 years-old. 
What would I tell myself back then, if I could? That was what @VictoriaUsher asked me for  GingerMay Marketing & PR  Advice to My Younger Self series, which gives career starters the chance to learn from senior leaders’ experiences. 
The question took me back to when I was sent a job ad by an ex-boyfriend, Patrick Chaundy  who worked at The Express Newspaper. It was for ad sales, selling classifieds at The Guardian (“after all”, he said, “you're quite left wing”...). 
Inspired by his confidence in me, I applied for the role and a similar one at The Observer. I will always remember my interview for The Guardian with @CarolineMarland. She handed me an ashtray and asked me to sell it to her. 

I failed miserably. 

A few days later,I had my interview at @The Observer, where I met @RhonaDrummond; she gave me my big chance, saying I should sell semi-display and skip the classifieds role. By then I had learned how to sell an ashtray. My schtick must have been impressive.
Being interviewed by two (the only two) female senior leaders on Fleet Street in 1986 meant I assumed this was a career path where women could get to the top and earn fantastic money. It seemed to be a meritocracy and that appealed to me. 
I was blessed to witness Fleet Street’s end and be at the heart of the media revolution delivered through desktop publishing. It was a chaotic, creative, and explosive time to be alive and to be working in our industry. 
I loved it. I grabbed every opportunity, being lucky enough to convince some incredibly senior male clients, such as Sir Ian McAllister, to back me. 
This was a time when a senior female would be the only girl in the leadership gang. I realise now how difficult it was to succeed in this environment, but I was never going (to) back down.
Often on this journey, I have felt lonely. I’ve been surprised and disappointed at how my success upsets people, making some men quite angry. 
While trying to buy @Spafax, a very posh lawyer from the sell side screamed at me in a meeting,""Who the fuck are you to buy Spafax?"" The room fell silent after. I sat there patiently and quietly, and thought, 'You've just fucked up, Mr Lawyer - we have all the cards now’ Staying calm and carrying on, that’s my super power.

I'd say to the young Mary Keane-Dawson, who made it to be an MD by 27 and went on to buy and sell several agencies, plus reconstruct a few more — well done. Congratulations. I'm very glad you stuck with it and never compromised yourself or your beliefs. Today you're surrounded by a wonderful family and fantastic friends, many of whom are former colleagues and clients. And you've helped pave the way for more female leaders.
Not a bad run at it, when all is said and done.",2023-05-02T11:10:29.195Z,no,no,"The post date is 2023-05-02, which is more than 12 months before the event date of September 18, 2024. Therefore, the post is not related to the DMEXCO 2024 event."

The technical interactions and the new learnings are definitely worthy aspects of such meetings. However, the greatest joy for me comes from meeting amazing people; people who are trustworthy, humble and down to earth even while they keep pushing the industry boundaries through their relentless innovations. Being able to pick the brains of such wonderful people, to learn from their vast experience and to get inspired are the true gems that I always return with from these meetings.
 
An opportunity to collect valuable insights happened last week in the CAEV Expo 2024 that happened in Bengaluru. Various stalls exhibiting some cool technologies catered to my head. The serving to my soul happened because of the ability to connect with an array of amazing people who were patient enough to answer my questions, explain their cool concepts and show me around their stalls.

This event showcased the power of the connections and relationships that keep our industry vibrant. We thrive on the partnerships we create and the connections we nurture. The event kicked off perfectly with the Dutch industry drinks hosted by VIA Nederland the evening before, setting the stage for a fantastic DMEXCO experience.
 
Some key takeaways if you’re considering attending next year and want to make the most of it:

1. Preparation is key, so start weeks in advance ⏰
Set your own goals and start scheduling meetings according to these goals
 
2. Join your international stand or partner with your German colleagues, as we did at Adform. Thank you for the great organisation, Adform marketing ❤️
 
3. Don’t want to go alone? Join a partner or a larger group! Reach out to organizations like VIA Nederland for my follow Dutchies. 🇳🇱 
 
4. Missing your prospect? Biggest client? Invite them! Don’t miss out on this opportunity to build new relationships. 🚀 
 
5. Don’t miss the OM Club for some disco dancing. It’s part of the DMEXCO experience. 🕺 

Biggest and most important takeaway: I highly recommend having a great wingman/wingwoman. Katja Henneveld was mine this year.  💁♀️

7239177363773693952,"""Nina, sehen wir uns eigentlich auf der DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference?"" Diese Frage bekomme ich aktuell ziemlich oft gestellt, denn ich war dazu bislang doch recht still – und wer mich kennt, weiß, dass ""still sein"" eigentlich nicht so mein Ding ist. 😉

Also, für alle, die sich gefragt haben: Ja, ich bin natürlich auf der #DMEXCO2024!

Was steht auf meinem Plan?
👉 Keynote: Wer Bock hat, ohne Bullshit-Bingo echtes KI-Handwerk und Strategie rund um angewandte künstliche Intelligenz zu erleben und zu verstehen, der muss die Keynote von Experience One CEO Kai Henrik Müller am 18.9. um 12:30 Uhr auf der Agency Stage anhören. Ich habe die Ehre, mit diesem unfassbar schlauen Typen und dem noch schlaueren Team dahinter zusammenzuarbeiten, und naja, man könnte sagen, ich bin biased, aber nein, ich meine es ernst: Es lohnt sich, ihr Mäuse!

👉 Standbesuche & Co: Ich empfehle die organisierten Talks von ODALINE & Jan Nicolas König beim Next Agency Summit, bin sehr gespannt auf die Moderation von Kim Alexandra Notz im Gespräch mit TikTok und freue mich auf die wundervolle Aissu Diallo und das Thema #socialfirst – und natürlich die Partys danach. Hab gehört, auf dem Stand von Adform gibt’s Kölsch und Currywurst? 😋

👉 Networking with me: Natürlich freue ich mich auf den Austausch abseits all der Keynotes, Stände und Schlaubi-Sessions. Wer spontan auf ein leckeres Kaltgetränk vorbeikommen möchte: Ich bin dieses Jahr mal wieder in GWA-Mission unterwegs. In diesem Jahr gibt’s einen GWA Wissens-Shuttle! Wir shuttlen den ganzen Tag und daher findet ihr mich eigentlich immer vor dem Eingang Nord – unschwer zu erkennen an einem ""unauffälligen"", gelben American School Bus, den wir zum GWA Shuttle umgebaut haben.

🚌 Was geht da so? Am Tag 1 der DMEXCO habt ihr die Möglichkeit, ab 11 Uhr ab dem Eingang Nord in unser Shuttle einzusteigen. Wir pendeln euch zwischen maximaler DMEXCO-Inspirations-Power und großartigem First-Hand Praxis-Know-how aus unserer GWA-Community zu den drei großen E’s: #Engagement, #Entertainment und #Experience.

Was euch erwartet? Was fürs 🧠 Hirn (#Brain-Food), was für den 🍲 🍹  Gaumen (leckeres #Food und #Drinks) und was zum Mitnehmen 🎁  (#Goodiebag)! 🎉

Warum? Lasst uns über die neuesten Themen unserer Branche sprechen und so #gemeinsam die #Zukunft gestalten. Denn nur, wenn wir zusammenarbeiten, können wir die aktuellen gesellschaftlichen Herausforderungen meistern und Digitale Transformation & Innovationen vorantreiben. Danke an den Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW) e.V., ohne den Support wäre der Shuttle  nicht möglich gewesen. Schön, dass wir gemeinsam die Branche weiterentwickeln können!

7247215001449451521,"I’ve long thought founders can make the best and worst CEOs.  So, it’s been interesting seeing this echoed in recent discussions about ‘Founder Mode’ — as perfectly explained in the summary below by Seb Joseph at Digiday.

Everyone agrees that creating a company calls for skills different from those required to manage the status quo or help an organisation scale. Generally, founders are seen as better equipped to take actions that initiate and maintain business success because they’ve earned the trust and credibility to do so, including being ready to break things and think outside the box. To this, I would add that it’s also crucial for founders to set a clear vision, mindset, and key principles that are instilled in all employees, including managers.

Yet founders can make the worst CEOs if the basic definition of “Founder Mode” is treated as an inflexible dictate. Sticking with a start-up mentality and tightly controlling every decision isn’t always the best call for their company or team, especially at the enterprise level. This is why I believe that openness to change, adaptation, and trusting talent must be part of how founders and managers function — and they can’t follow a predefined path or way of operating.

I could write about 10 pages on why any company would be lucky to have Quentin but I'll try to summarise it in a few points: 

🚀 Solution-Driven: If there's a problem, he will find a way to resolve it without getting stuck. 
🌟 Inspiring Leader: He has a knack for bringing out the best in people (speaking from a personal experience too!)
💼 Financially Astute: When it comes to financial decisions, he has a real talent for identifying opportunities that drive growth.
🛡️ Strategic Risk Manager: when things go south, you want Quentin on your side. He has a gift for anticipating potential issues and dealing with them effectively.
⚙️ Operational Expert: Quentin has a way of making complex operations look easy (and explaining those to others 🙋♀️).

Speaking from my heart, I highly recommend chatting with Quentin if you're in the market for a top-tier COO. And I have to admit, I'm terribly jealous of those who will get to work with him next. You're in for a treat!","Good morning Network, Happy Monday ☀️ !

7242104700282490880,"With the launch of Scope3 Germany this year and our continued expansion across Europe, we knew we wanted to attend DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference. But how to do that sustainably?

First, send people that can take trains or short flights, and where a flight is necessary, make the most of it. As an example, Brenda Tuohig bundled a vacation into her trip to save a flight, and also spent a day in London on her way.

Second, make sure every aspect of the experience is seen through a sustainable lens:
• Plants are provided by a local supplier who rent and reuse plants for many tradeshows and events 
• Branded Dopper water bottles for guests - an ocean-saving bottle meeting the toughest environmental and ethical standards, made in a factory that runs on 100% renewable energy making its carbon footprint zero
• A water dispenser inside the meeting house to fill/refill the water bottles for meetings and on-the-go
• Snacks and energy pick-me-ups in eco-friendly packaging (avoiding plastic)
• For the Executive Dinner - our guests will be escorted by branded bike taxis from the venue to the restaurant, Neobiota, a michelin star restaurant with sustainable gastronomy as a top priority. This includes short supply chains with local ingredients, avoiding wastage and partnering with sustainable producers. • Guest name cards have also been printed on seed paper which can be taken home and planted to grow wildflowers.

Third, remind your CEO that all of these choices save money too. International flights are expensive! Fancy booths that you throw away every year are expensive! It's the same story we tell clients about sustainable advertising: reducing waste is good for the planet AND good for the pocketbook. It's just smart business.

But I digress... What many people don’t realise is how incredibly tough it is to break into the premium beverage market without insider business intelligence and expert support from those with real-world experience. We couldn't have made it in (nevermind last 5 years of live operations) without the timely mentorship and hands-on guidance of some truly generous industry heavies from Stellenbosch's world-renowned wine and grape juice scene.

I will be speaking at the Agencies Stage. 
On Thursday, September 19, 2024 10:10 AM to 11:00 AM · 50 min. (Europe/Berlin)

To talk about : The Most Valuable Unused Resource in AI Transformation

But not only me, I will be there with :
Alissa Rabe , Moderation, Google
Dora Osinde Osinde, Chief Creative Officer, Ogilvy GmbH
Robert Andersen, MD Creators, Jung von Matt
Matthias Maurer, Gründer und GF, la red
Jack Smyth, Chief Solutions Officer for AI, Planning and Insights (API), Jellyfish

What will be talking about: While AI models are becoming increasingly powerful, use cases are evolving slowly, and value gains remain modest. The gap between CAPEX and expected returns has now reached the trillions.

The most critical resource for driving applicable AI transformation in companies remains untapped. And no, it's not customer data or GPU seconds.

The topics:
#DigitalTransformation
#DigitalCreativity
#Agencies

Great to be back to Germany and inspired by all the incredible professionals and marketers on stage!
I could share my vision on communication and advertising in an era of uncertainty: creativity and differentiation are paramount. A brand can be omniprésent on Instagram and on Tik Tok but without a deeper meaning behind, that visibility will not bring any company very far. 
When all supermarkets seem a sea of sameness, it is time to cast aside from conformity and reintroduce originality. 
Thank you Maike Abel  for the opportunity to share these deep convinctions on stage, presenting the case of the reinvention of such an iconic brand like Perrier. 

« Flowers are ads. Peacock’s tails are ads. One reason I’m not predicting the death of advertising any time soon is that you can see how important it is in nature. A flower is basically a weed with an advertising budget. »

▶️ Customer-centric is dead. Long live life-centric!

▶️ Building a customer ecosystem around customer lives offers growth opportunities.

▶️ Many companies already actively engage with ecosystems; however, they are just getting started.

▶️ Build up a strategy and define the scope. Partner with others. Build sustainable business models, and use tech and data to improve.

▶️ Top management, budget, culture, capabilities, and sometimes help are necessary ingredients for success.

But my favorite quote was ""Do the right things - Do the things right!""

What do you think about these points to become more customer-centric? Please leave your feedback in the comments! 👇 Thanks.

In our latest #DMEXCO podcast episode, Daniel Knapp, Chief Economist at IAB Europe, and I are diving deep into the world of #DigitalAdvertising - which is becoming more and more volatile. 

I personally love to listen to Daniel because I am convinced, that he has the best data on the European online advertising market - and I learn so much from him. Here are some key highlights of this episode:

📈 The unexpected 11% growth in 2023 and what drove it.
📊 The psychological impact of the #polycrisis on budget allocation.
📉 The slow erosion of banner ads and the rise of video and audio formats.
📊 Why marketers tend to rely on short-term ROI metrics.

Yes, it was MASSIVE, it was IMPRESSIVE and one could think that InnoTrans is a “big kids” playground (and the LEGO Group train fans can’t deny it 😉 ).

Still, beyond all the #signaling, the #digitalization, and the buzzing #AI boosting rail automatization to reach the targeted #GoA4 Rail #autonomy, the most impressive was elsewhere!

Let’s reflect here and share why I found it so special:

* I met with many strong, determined, and resilient women 
* I saw the power of Women in Mobility
* I witnessed colleagues' and bosses' support, promotion, and leverage that effectively encouraged women at work.

It is one thing to raise future generations to enjoy the “diversity of different and complementary” approaches; it is another thing to witness it.

During the past 20 years, we asked ourselves several times, why is it, that every single car visualizer we have encountered can turn a car, can change its color and if you are super adventurous it can change the background. 

But why do none of them have a car you can drive?
It is kind of the point, isn’t it?

So we set with a brand new blazing-fast server architecture and environment that comes straight out of the TVC, optimized, tested, and ready for interactive exploration. 

This server stuff is so fast, that you can run on a super high-res streamed model on your shaking wobbling phone in Augmented Reality.

Additionally, #Porsche has created a limited edition #collectible model car based on VEXX's design.  Perfect for any Porsche or racing or art fan!

Last Friday brought an unfortunate turn of events as MediaMath officially ceased operations. Throughout the past two years, I have had the honour of advising the EMEA/APAC leadership and subsequently leading the EMEA commercial business.
During this remarkable journey, I enjoyed collaborating with many exceptional individuals with unique talents. Their eagerness to learn, ability to think outside the box, and unwavering dedication to creativity and teamwork have truly distinguished them as an outstanding team.
In this photo, we captured one of our last successful meetings in Italy, a moment filled with happiness and pride as everything unfolded according to plan.

I firmly believe that as a company, you have to anchor diversity within your culture, it needs to be a long-term commitment and not just some action on women’s day or during pride month. 

I also think that for true authenticity, diversity and inclusion need to have leadership attention and support. Is the leadership of a company literally SHOWING UP at IDE events? Are they genuinely interested in the way that people feel included or not included? Are employees asked their opinion?

Esta semana IAB Spain ha publicado su informe sobre creadores de contenido y su nueva realidad: El valor del engagement; elaborado junto a Go Talent a través de Primetag. En él se reflexiona sobre la importancia del #engagement frente al número de seguidores, algo que me lleva rondando la cabeza en los últimos meses cada vez que tengo delante una campaña de #influencermarketing. ¿Debemos valorar más la cantidad o la calidad? ¿De qué me sirve un número muy alto de #seguidores si mi contenido no consigue llegar a la mitad de ellos? Desde nuestra posición como agencia y consultoría creo que es realmente interesante que transmitamos este valor a las marcas que deseen emprender acciones en redes.
 
Los creadores seleccionados tenían más de 100,000 seguidores en Instagram o más de 300,000 en TikTok, con un engagement rate medio de al menos 2%, y una audiencia española de al menos 30%. Tras analizar su comportamiento en las redes, el estudio recoge que la interacción es la métrica clave, y el contenido creativo debe ser personal y bien ejecutado técnicamente. El engagement debe construirse a largo plazo e ir más allá del mundo online. La libertad creativa es esencial para el éxito de las colaboraciones entre marcas y creadores.
 
La conclusión está clara: las redes son un mundo en constante cambio y debemos adaptarnos a ello. Hace no tantos meses tener un volumen alto de seguidores era fundamental para que una campaña funcionase, ahora debemos poner el foco en la calidad de estos followers antes de lanzarnos a la piscina. 
 
Dejo por aquí el estudio que, desde mi humilde opinión, aporta mucho valor.

As an operator, install one simple script and monetise traffic from countries you are not allowed to convert, basically monetise remnant inventory easily.

A great example would be a brand like Betano who was a headline sponsor of Euro2024 but only accepts players from a short list of countries, a solution like FTDx would have helped improve the ROI on what I'm sure was a very expensive campaign. 

Was a lot of fun to chat with Bjorn and I'm expecting big things.

My Takeaways from DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference m

Retail Media Networks (RMNs) has been a hot topic in our industry for a while, but after attending #Dmexco2024, the landscape is shifting. With over 200 RMNs competing for finite marketing pounds, agency executives are urging brands to take a more strategic, calculated approach to their RMN investments.

At Dmexco, I had many conversations about the growing pressure on brands to increase media spend commitments, with retailers eyeing national brand marketing budgets to evolve into full-service ad platforms. However, more spending doesn’t always mean better results. We’re seeing a point of diminishing returns, with rising CPMs, inconsistent performance across networks, and too much focus on bottom-of-the-funnel performance.

For smaller RMNs, competing against giants like #WalmartConnect, #AmazonAds, and #Target's Roundel will require either consolidation or lower pricing models. As marketers, we must consider all the options—whether investing in RMNs or exploring ad tech alternatives like Xandr and Evidnt. At Bicycle, we’re focused on helping clients prioritise where their pounds go based on distribution, product availability, and sales goals.

The big question remains: With the cost of retail media rising and performance measures still lacking standardisation, is the juice worth the squeeze? As I learned at #Dmexco, brands must now take a more data-driven, strategic approach to ensure their investments move the needle.

What do you think about the future of #RetailMedia? Are we headed toward consolidation, or will we see innovation that justifies the rising costs? Let’s discuss it!

Love your *Advice To My Younger Self*. 

We’ve all been there - missing an afternoon appointments after a long lunch.","Well that’s quite something … 

The 23-year old Dino - snapped in this picture on a night out with friends at Mediacom would not recognise the father-of-two and agency owner that stares back at him in the mirror every morning. 

As part of a series by GingerMay , Advice to My Younger Self - where successful business leaders give guidance to those in the early stages of their career - CEO Victoria Usher asked for my pearls of wisdom.

And it made me reflect on where I’ve come from and what I’ve learned. 

My days now at The Barber Shop -  the strategy-led creative media agency that I founded in 2019 - are filled with bold ideas and strategic workshops. Back then, I was focussed on work, my friends and exploring London’s nightlife - like most my age. 

I recall that my first boss in media gave me a list of 10 things to master in my first three months. One of these was going to lunch with media owners at least twice a week. I made a good attempt at doing this - sometimes too good an attempt. 

Like the one time my lunch went on and on and on … and on. 

Embarrassingly returned to the office to learn that I had completely missed my afternoon client meeting. I was young, foolish and a press buyer, so learnt the fast and hard way - that sometimes lunches could be ‘too’ good.

If I had to advise my younger self, I would recommend seeking inspiration from a boss who excites and motivates you with their drive and balance. I was fortunate to work under Jenny Biggam, who provided exactly that, although I had to wait ten years into my career for that privilege.

In addition to this advice, once you find someone whose vision and energy you admire, make them your mentor, and ask them to open doors for you and grant you access.

This advice is something I would give to my children, Jojo (9) and Marley (6), who admirably and stubbornly battle to overcome every challenge themselves. I hope they embrace and enjoy their first job, a wonderful time of life when you can make mistakes and not take things too seriously before settling down.

It was a pleasure to share the stage with industry experts like Tim Soulo, Irene Oh, and Silvia Mogas Web3 Marketing PR, who shared invaluable insights and practical approaches to how marketers can stay ahead of the curve in such a fast-evolving landscape.

Fun fact: Tim was a speaker at the very first marketing conference I attended at the beginning of my career, a full-circle moment! 

It’s amazing to see how much the industry has changed since then with new technologies and platforms that are now a staple to our marketing strategies. It's also personally exciting to now be on the other side of the table, facilitating conversations about the future of marketing.

Here are 3 quick takeaways from our discussion:
💡 Focus on agility, data-driven decisions, and stay in tune with emerging trends
💡 Understand your customers and know your USPs
💡 AI is here to stay and we need to leverage its potential while balancing personalisation

🎯 The Return on investment is also about giving your employees a chance to talk to the market and to understand what the needs are of those who use or might use your product.

📰 I work in PR and read what's being said about the brand I work for every day, but getting feedback from people who use that product (and not just newspapers and journalists) is crucial. 

🍺 And then the ROI means also giving the opportunity to spend days together with a team that you see most of the time on a screen. Laughing, getting to know each other, and drinking together are some of the best investments we can make for ourselves.

About 2 weeks ago, I had an accident and had to have emergency knee surgery. From day 1, the company I work for, Brightcom, and all of the people there were all so supportive and did all they could to help me, send me get well gifts and messages and were just there for me through the difficult time before and after the surgery and to this day, keep asking me how I'm doing and if there's anything they can do to help me in any way and go above and beyond to make sure I'm doing better. 

A lot of people simply work for a company and that's where it ends but at Brightcom, it's more than that, we're a Brightcom family and even though it's always felt like that for me, this has shown me even more that this is how it is. Yes, we all work there but we are more than just that and that's why Brightcom is as good as it is. Everyone there is there for each other. It's a long road to recovery still but I'm lucky to be part of a family like Brightcom!

If a company cares this much about it's employees then you know they care about their partners too and the digital publishers we work with already will know this. 

I want to thank everyone at Brightcom for everything they've done for me! You're all amazing!

7242550266791706627,"DMEXCO complete! Another year of excellent opportunity to reconnect with friends and colleagues, and this year was special for me for a couple of reasons:


🔹 First (party data) things first: Companies are rightly focusing on building robust first-party data strategies to protect their customers, develop better insights, and maximize marketing performance despite some ambiguity on 3PC deprecation. Our rockstar Googlers René Zimmermann Christiane Adler Heidi Menz and Sarah O'Hara did an amazing job sharing updates on exactly these topics!


🔹Retail Media continues to mature: Closing the loop between awareness and performance presents a huge opportunity, with ongoing efforts to develop measurement standards and best practices among brands, retailers, and platform partners. The recent study from EHI on Retail Media underscores this common opinion. Thanks to Corinna Hohenleitner Dennie-Alexander Trost Marie-Clare Puffett Christian Leihner and Nikolaus Roettger for the great panel discussion!


🔹AI is becoming operational: While in the early stages, there is broad agreement that AI can drive efficiencies across various business challenges for retailers, from creative production to customer care. Many are still learning and determining where to prioritize their efforts, but it is exciting to see how clients like Douglas and Lufthansa are making it work. Jana van den Bos Riz Syed and Yves Dupont showed how AI is coming to life at Douglas!

I would also like to give a huge shout to our product team who was there to help clients understand our newly announced “Confidential Computing” capability which offers a valuable layer of additional security when leveraging 1st party data to drive performance across Google Ads solutions. Quaseer M. Chanda Patel John Tobler Thank you so much for coming over to be here in person to meet our customers and partners!

7242158622997196800,"I have a few thoughts about all the #DMEXCO updates Google announced (some good, some not so good). 

First, be sure to read the great recap from Ginny Marvin here: https://lnkd.in/ev93Fn2R

The Objectively Good:
😄 More PMax data is always a good thing and I'm really excited about target pacing and asset insights! Also the campaign level negatives (without the need for a form)! We are getting impression share metrics (fist spotted by Odi Caspi) but I have mixed feelings about those. 

😄 Pinning for demand gen videos is a godsend! No longer are we rolling the dice on Google understanding the best placement/length for our content. 

😄 AI visual enhancement for all campaign types is a huge boon ahead of Q4! I'm extremely excited to see how the seed images and text descriptions help improve the AI for PMax and Search campaigns alike.  

The Optimist's Excitement:
😍 I'm very interested in the asset recommendations and I'm wondering if this is a sign that the LLMs are getting more intelligent around how different creative resonates with different personas.

😍 I'm fully team brand guidelines and while I know others are cynical about them, I truly believe they will help.

😍 Multi-lingual asset generation can be really good or really bad. I'm leaning into hope here. 

The Cynic's Reservations:
🤔 PMax getting impression share is more concerning to me than anything else. Impression share can only be for search and shopping, and getting that data does two potentially harmful things. It reenforces search bias when the point of PMax is to remove the bias from budget allocation. It also sets us up to hear about a problem that can only be solved by more budget. One of the reasons I love using impression share is to find structural areas to improve campaigns - that's not really possible with PMax...you just add more budget or limit what you're going after. 

🤔 I'm not crazy about 360 getting more tools. More often than not, 360 is more trouble than it's worth, and while enterprise brands can have valid uses for it, there are a lot of folks who struggle to recover from the migration. I'd have liked to see tools for the little guys as opposed to more 360 enhancements.

🤔 Google outright said PMax wouldn't get impression share last year. Now it's rolling out for search and shopping. I can't help but wonder if this is one of the foundational steps to make search/shopping exclusively available through PMax (which isn't inherently a bad thing but not everyone is prepared for that campaign type). This feels especially true since Google's search text advertising business would be a monopoly (if the US could define it as a market), while search advertising was not a monopoly. 

Which update are you the most excited for?    ",,2024-09-18T13:12:48.500Z,yes,yes,"The post date is 2024-09-18, which is the same as the event date for DMEXCO 2024.

7071742120260194304,"“One more thing” - Apple‘s released its Vision Pro headset! 

My first thoughts on the specs:

🥽 High-end standalone device (6DoF) with outstanding resolution, which is key to a great experience (6.5x pixels per eye than Quest 2, >4K resolution per eye) - this is unprecedented in such a compact device.

🥽 Innovative input approach by tracking eyes, hands, and voice in combination - yet, the absence of controllers is something that could reduce the productivity and versatility of apps (probably controllers might be added for some use cases at a later point in time, just as the Apple Pencil for iPad).

🥽 Great integration of presence features blending your environment in/out using cameras and a screen on the outside of the headset 

🥽 Battery pack in tether to your pocket - smart decision to reduce weight and increase comfort. Magic Leap has already demonstrated the benefits of this approach. For those saying the cable looks weird: I’d rather have a cable on my headset, than 200-400g of additional weight on my head. Trust me, this makes a big difference. 

🥽 3D recording and picturing - this is a big one, as it will enable new dimensions of creating memories and experiences. Probably this feature is to come for iPhone and iPad in the future too.

🥽 Diopter lenses that can be bought to solve the uncomfortable experience for anyone wearing glasses - great solution once you have your own device, but might be difficult to handle for multi-user headsets (e.g. demos or shared devices).

🥽 User ID identification via iris scan - this could solve the ongoing discussion on identity theft in virtual worlds.

How to get it?

💥 Market availability in early 2024 - Although reports suggest Apple is still tweaking some components, developers have been provided with ample information to start creating applications for this new platform. No information regarding availability and pricing outside the US yet.

💥 Price point 3499 USD - certainly not cheap, but considering the specs built-in, reasonable. 

Overall conclusion: I expect a great push of value adding solutions in the immersive tech/ metaverse environment. Also I see a market opportunity for other players like  Meta, PICO XR, HTC VIVE, and Lenovo  - targeting a different price segment with their solution. Businesses will have to ask: “Which headset offers the specifications I need for my specific use case?“

Most important point to consider, as with any immersive headset - try it first, before you jump to final conclusions.

Home. Do you know that feeling that after 7+ years of being an expat you finally “feel home”? What does “home” even mean? Is it this abstract thing where your feelings of belonging are through the roof as you wander along the streets of the city? 

Home. Utopical place, where you can breathe freely and you get an immediate sense of belonging.

Home. Home. Home… never felt like this in the dark & dirty city of Berlin. 

Somehow though I knew that I have to keep looking for this new place, for this new HOME. You know, in 2017 I’ve left Latvia because I find this society and a development vector toxic. 

I hate the nationalism that has ruined my once beloved country.

🌙 And after many years of travelling & looking, I’ve found this feeling of “home” here, in the Caucasus mountains. 

I am accepted here no matter my mother tongue. 
I am accepted here no matter my character. 
I am accepted here and I do belong, even knowing that I am flying back and forth. 

A great Latvian poet once said: “Mājas ir tur, kur tu pārnāc rūpju pilns un sirds iesāpās no skaistuma” (eng. Home is where you come full of worries and your heart hurts from the beauty).

7028618374725128192,"I met Alice Talotti (Agency Solutions Manager at Meta) recently in Frankfurt and talked with her about the #Future of #DigitalMarketing. Here are my questions and her answers:

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲?

1. Creativity will need to be front and center. You can’t build a brand or sell products if you’re not uniquely positioned. This also means working with the latest products available in the market - at the moment definitely entertain with short-form videos or connect with customers through messaging rather than email.

2. Automation will set us up for success. Marketers need to understand that working together with a machine will ultimately make them better, not take away their job.

3. Connect your marketing activities and don’t think in individual channels or funnel steps. A consumer does not think in channels or funnels either. Make it easier for consumers to experience your brand: Implement as many touchpoints as possible - but do it in a meaningful way. No one wants to see lame content because of brand guidelines or chat with a very obvious bot. Be bold and experiment!

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘃𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘀?

Influencer or rather creator marketing is not to be underestimated. Creators are the ones who use social media or entertainment platforms in the best way - they create trends and are usually among the early adopters of new products and understand what entertains and engages their audience. Virtual influencers basically do the same. So I think they probably should not be underestimated either.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲?

We’re still in a pre-metaverse era. It’s not quite here yet but it is definitely worth exploring NOW. There is no roadmap or checklist to follow - we all don’t know what the metaverse will look like exactly. For marketers, it’s important to take the first steps towards what the metaverse could be, get familiar with what it can offer, and how to use it best. Think of how to bring a real benefit to your customers: For starters, this could just be creating an augmented reality filter to drive deeper brand connections today.

It might still be considered to be a work in progress, but it doesn’t stop savvy brands from exploring virtual environments as another way to reach consumers. 

Based on Sitecore’s report, 42% of U.S. consumers are enthusiastic when it comes to the metaverse, with about 9 in 10 (87%) predicting that it will play a crucial role in how they interact with brands in the future. 

With such enormous enthusiasm, it’s a perfect timing for marketers to start planning for and building metaverse-like experiences.

Some marketers are already aware of that, as 67% of them claim the metaverse will become a dominant platform for interacting with consumers, and 79% of consumers predict that they will be spending more time on the metaverse than on popular social media platforms.

Will more and more brands invest in the metaverse as a way to reach consumers, what do you think?

7161485706069053440,"Through my last 14 years in the Promotional market I have been attending what should now be hundreds of Trade Shows and Road Shows, most of the times as exhibitor.
During this period I have collected a reasonably good amount of experience on the fine art of promoting a commercial offer and I faced enough episodes to write a book. Unfortunately I’m not patient enough to go through such a daunting task and I will restrict myself to write a few lines here.
Life as an exhibitor has as ultimate goal leaving a lasting impression on what you are promoting on the victims (AKA the visitors) that during a show must face dozens (if not hundreds) of booths that several times are presenting overlapping products. So during these events many times the exhibitor must become the exhibitionist and selling the dream of the perfect offer composed of products no one else have (though job) with the lowest prices in the market (borderline mission impossible) and all wrapped up in a perfect level of service with the guarantee of zero incidents (and here we are touching the realm of Paradise). 
If all of this was not schizophrenic enough, then a multiplicity of potential episodes just turns the most resilient mind into a poor soul seeking desperately for the end of the event. Let me name just a few I’ve faced during these years:
- There is a farmers’ strike and all the roads are blocked. Convert your expectation of hundreds of visitors to a fraction of it (this also works with heavy rain or snow). 
- A client arrives to the booth with a box full of badly printed pens and demanding a compensation on the spot (in front of all the other visitors). Prepare yourself to be as conciliatory as Gandhi.
- The transport company failed and you have zero samples to show on the exposition. Incredible levels of creativity are requested, including renting 4 giant screens to project your website.
- You find yourself in the middle of a presentation to a visitor with doubtful potential when you see a top 10 client leaving the booth without talking with anyone. Compress your speech in 5 sentences and don’t let the big fish abandon your boat!
- The catalogues run out by the middle of the second day. Stop blaming the marketing department and offer samples with the business card tagged on them.
- One of the guys of your team extended the “client networking” in the previous night a bit too long and is looking like a zombie. Pass him two aspirins, a double expresso and a Red Bull.
Despite all the pain and suffering, Trade Shows are unique moments, where people, that many times spent the entire year exchanging mails and phone calls, have finally the opportunity to meet face to face. In that sense Trade Shows are the antipodes of the ever accelerating Digitalization in our Market and it’s interesting to see that they have not lost their importance (in fact nowadays we have bigger number of structured events than we had 10 years ago).

#AI everywhere. That’s my summary of yesterday’s #CMO-Forum, where 60 fellow CMOs and I explored the future of #marketing, with AI taking center stage – from research to execution. It's crystal clear: AI is the ultimate game-changer for efficiency, #automation, speed, and personalized impact. Just think about translation and localization – tailoring campaigns for eeeeevery market with almost zero effort. 🤯 📈 

And here’s the fun part: we did a little experiment – AI-generated images vs. real-shot images – and 99% of us CMOs could still tell the difference!!! Controversial, right? Is AI ""good enough""? I think it is. The fast-paced digital world demands speed over perfection... and let’s be real... consumers’ attention spans are shorter than ever. 😉 
 
That was already a highlight... but the truuuue standout moment came in the evening: the #CMOoftheYear award gala. Key takeaways? Florian Haller nailed it in his dinner keynote: the modern CMO must master brand, demand, #tech, and most importantly: data, data, data! 🎶 Maybe that’s why I love what I do so much...

Biiiig shoutout to Daniel Grieder, CEO & CMO of BOSS, who took home the prestigious CMO of the Year award 🏆, recognizing the remarkable #transformation and turnaround of BOSS, with 2023 being its strongest year yet. The biggest risk? Taking no risk. (Kafka would agree. 😉) CONGRATS!! And soooo well deserved! 

Also, a huge congrats to Stefan Hoechter of Adelholzer for the CMO Lifetime Achievement Award. His mantra? It's all about people, trust, and creating safe spaces. Amen to that! When you lead with care, performance follows. Sounds familiar, right? 😛  

Shoutout to some of the fantastic leaders who joined the discussion and made all of this happen: Florian Haller Yvonne Wicht, Stefanie Kuhnhen, Ronald Focken, Timo Wolf, Jutta Meyer, Giuseppe Fiordispina, and Barbara Mai.

Event planners LOVE content.

Whenever I've been presenting about how events are content machines, the nodding in the room goes wild.

'Julius, nodding? Is that it?'

Of course not.

Boldpush research says that 75% of event professionals repurpose content.

To add more, the second largest category of eventtech by spend is content management. Boldpush research also says.

I shared it before: a one-hour session = 121 insights.

This incredible content production can be:

- The social media content for months.
- The video marketing that converts attendees.
- The upsell to a content hub
- The email collection tactic to beef up your database.

It will also provide the data to inform you about the content you'll bring to the show floor at the next event.

If you have an AV team on site, I'll be personally angry with you if you don't capture that content.

You can make this happen.

Are you capturing content this year?

As we wrap up an exciting and insightful few days at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference it was fantastic to reconnect with partners 🤝, engage with new clients 💬, and explore innovative product solutions.

A standout moment was Sascha Lobo’s keynote 🎤, which truly captivated the audience. He painted both a thought-provoking and inspiring vision for the future of marketing, urging the community to embrace change and be part of the next big shift.  

On the Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW) e.V. panel “risk-free growth via affiliate marketing” the speakers highlighted endless opportunities for businesses to tap into this dynamic space. 📈

Key insights included the rising importance of multi-channel integration, the growing adoption of RCS for secure messaging, and exciting opportunities in conversational marketing through platforms like WhatsApp. It’s clear that the future of customer engagement is all about seamless, personalised, and secure communication! 

Have a read below for more detailed insights!

#DMEXCO #DigitalMarketing #MessagingTrends","DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference proved to be a highly productive event for our DACH team. We spoke with numerous industry leaders and listened to the evolving needs of businesses in the region. We couldn’t keep these key insights to ourselves, so here’s what we’ve learned about creating a future-proof marketing and messaging strategy.

🌐 Multi-channel integration is crucial 
In the DACH region, businesses focus on multi-channel integration to provide seamless transitions between online and offline experiences. By linking local platforms with global systems, they meet regional preferences while ensuring trust across all channels.

📲 Growing interest in RCS in DACH
RCS interest is growing quickly in the DACH region, offering enhanced messaging that aligns with consumers' expectations for secure, high-quality interactions. In a region that priorities data security and privacy, RCS is a great messaging tool due to its verification function. 

💬 Conversational marketing opportunities 
Conversational marketing in the DACH region centres on personalised, real-time interactions through popular platforms like WhatsApp. Businesses are embracing tools that foster trust and meaningful customer engagement.

starts next week. I want to share some thoughts and tips on how you can maximize your time in Las Vegas. These tips are in conjunction with the video.
1). Get a god nights rest before the conference starts. Everything is a blur after that.
2). Wear your best suit or business attire.Have at least 2 outfits. You can switch up to something business casual at night.
3).Arrive early for the sessions and get a seat down front. Now you have a chance to interact with the moderator and the panelists at the end.
4).Download the G2E app and schedule the events and meetings that you want to attend.
5). Envision what you want to accomplish.If you can see it ,you can do it.
6). Send a thank you email or card after any interaction that you found fruitful. Mention the interaction and how you appreciated the time. Most people won’t do this so you will stand out when you do.
7).Utilize your social media and share your G2E experience along with hashtags.
These tips work for a neophyte or a conference veteran.

","In what has been a sad, dark and challenging time for Israel the past few weeks, I have some good news, a spark of bright light, to share. Today, Palo Alto Networks announced its intent to acquire Talon Cyber Security! 
 
This is a strategic move that, once closed, will align incredible teams and technologies to execute on the vision of securing ALL users, from EVERY device, that access corporate applications and data. 
 
When we started Talon, we had a bold goal: to power and protect as many leading organizations and as many users as possible. By combining Talon’s Enterprise Browser technology with Prisma® SASE after closing, we will only accelerate our vision and provide more value to our customers. 
 
This milestone represents a new chapter in Talon’s journey – a chapter that will consist of unmatched innovation, value added, strong Go-To-Market, and its fair share of additional milestones. 
 
As an entrepreneur, I could not be more excited to see something the team and I helped shape and build, become a part of the strategy of one of the world’s true cybersecurity leaders. 
 
This also serves as a clear testament to the strength and resilience of the Israeli tech community. We continue to deliver, continue to push boundaries, and continue to have success, #nomatterwhat. 
 
To my co-founder, Ohad Bobrov, thank you so much for your dedication and partnership. I wouldn’t want to be on this journey with anyone else.  
 
To my amazing wife, Dana El-On, thank you for your unwavering love, support, and for pushing me to be a better leader and entrepreneur, every day. 
 
Last, and absolutely not least, a huge thank you to our team members, customers, partners, and investors for your support and impact. We look forward to continuing to work closely with you all to tackle challenges and make the world a safer, more secure place.

“A conference without a killer party is like pancakes without the maple syrup. Like gin without the tonic. Like rock without the roll. In other words, no conference is complete without one.

And to a good end … As I always remind clients, “No deals were ever forged in the main speaking hall. They begin with an intro, with a drink, with a “Have you met … Ted?””

Having said all that, there are parties, and then there’s the OMClub party that the folks from PIRATE Summit host on the night of DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference in Cologne, Germany. …

Now, I’m not going to tell you that the OMClub party is the best one I’ve ever been too, because it’s not. But it IS the best business related party I’ve ever seen.“

Some might say it’s unusual to stay in a role this long, but it’s really a testament to the company and most importantly, the incredible team around us. Let’s face it, when you’re working with rockstars, it’s hard to leave the band. 🎸

So here’s to Justin Skogen, Digital Envoy, and to all the IP geeks who keep the wheels turning (you know who you are). Cheers to the years, the data, the laughs, and the inevitable debates about IP address ranges. 🍻

Here are quotes from my teammates on the impact GKO had on them and why everyone is fired up even more:

""This feels more like a President Club trip than a Kickoff. I'm so fired up.""

""This is best work trip of my life. I love the culture and identity we are building.""

""That was a stellar GKO. The best one yet.""

""I've never been so inspired to work at a company. That was truly incredible.""

""This was a great opportunity to bring together the entire GTM organization globally and learn how our customers are leveraging the Glean platform to transform their business.""

""We have an amazingly talented team that gives each other grace for support and collective grit to push and grow across GTM, ENG, R+D.""

""A huge thank you to my Glean team, whose perfect blend of heart, execution, and customer obsession makes achievements like this possible. Here's to many more milestones together!""

Here's how to pitch them to your clients:

➞ Events have higher ROI
Splash shared how attendees buy more and how events deliver more pipeline and ROI.

➞ One glance is worth 1,000 words
In many, many industries experiencing a product in-person matters a lot. A funnel that starts online needs to be closed in-person. 

➞ You can't fake events ( I am gonna trademark this one)
AI has trust issues. You can trust events. It’s where humans show up. Events will have a crucial role in 2024 with so many elections happening. We will attend events to understand reality.

➞ Data Goldmine 
In a cookieless, GDPR & CCPA world, events are a first-party data feast. Currently the second overall channel in B2B, it will climb up in 2024.

➞ Real Human Connection
The more we use social networks, the more we seek interaction with real people. The post-pandemic rebound is a case study for future generations.

➞ Co-creating Marketing 
The power of making your customers experience your brand is unrivaled. When they can interact with it live, it’s a different game.

➞ Peers and Community
Meeting other customers, peers, and community members is an unrivaled level of engagement. 

➞ Content That Travels Far
Every event is a huge content creation opportunity that can play into all stages of the funnel.

O #retailmedia está a dissolver uma barreira antiga: a separação entre o marketing de marca e o marketing de desempenho. 
Num painel da DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference 2024, Daniel Knapp, do IAB Europe, destacou que o canal emergente tem o potencial de alinhar dois mundos que até então têm sido vistos como opostos.
De facto, com a crescente utilização de dados, inteligência artificial e segmentação, os profissionais de marketing estão a transformar suas estratégias. Os resultados falam por si: cada vez mais orçamentos estão a migrar da televisão tradicional para o retail media; mas a grande questão que paira sobre as marcas é: será que o retail media também consegue impulsionar a construção de marca a longo prazo?

Há definitivamente muitos desafios, especialmente em termos de medição e provas independentes do impacto na marca. Acresce que a falta de uma padronização entre as diferentes redes de retail media também dificulta a optimização dos gastos.

Estamos, parece, num ponto de viragem -- e se o retail media conseguir ultrapassar essas barreiras e provar o seu valor para o marketing de branding, podemos estar prestes a testemunhar a verdadeira convergência entre branding e performance.

📈 Vale a pena ler mais sobre estas e outras tendências do futuro do digital discutidas na DMEXCO.

🤝At Valtech, we don’t just talk about partnerships — we live them. 
From the very beginning, I was convinced by Valtech's approach to building meaningful, long-term collaborations. They don’t just focus on technology or sales; they prioritize a shared culture and vision with their partners. This commitment to true partnership is what sets Valtech apart.

Recently, I had the opportunity to see this firsthand when we brought together experts from five leading companies—Tetyana Keyvan from commercetools, Roberto Vlad from Contentstack, Philip Geiger from Algolia, Karl Morgan from inriver, and Markus Cansever from Valtech. 

📈Our joint goal? To collaborate on a proposal that would help our joint client elevate their digital commerce landscape .

As I look forward to DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference next week, this meeting wasn’t just fun — it was the kind of collaboration I want to embrace in the future. The energy, expertise, and shared commitment we had today is exactly how I envision working going forward. A special thanks to every attendee for contributing to this inspiring session. 

However, success in such a collaboration doesn’t come without its challenges.

⏰ 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒆 1: 𝑪𝒐𝒐𝒓𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑩𝒖𝒔𝒚 𝑺𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒍𝒆𝒔 
Bringing two SMEs, one managing director, and four account executives to the same table across multiple companies was no easy task. But once we aligned our schedules, the depth of insight and expertise shared was invaluable 💡

🔑 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒆 2: 𝑩𝒖𝒊𝒍𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑻𝒓𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑳𝒐𝒏𝒈-𝑻𝒆𝒓𝒎 𝑽𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏 
Partnerships are not about short-term gains. They require trust, transparency, and loyalty. Valtech’s commitment to fostering these principles ensures that every partner is fully invested in delivering the best outcomes, making each collaboration a long-term success 🔖 

🧩 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒆 3: 𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝑨𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒏𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝑲𝒆𝒚 
Finding the right people within your own organization is just as important as working with external partners. Valtech’s internal experts, Bertrand Payet and Samuel Geiger, brought unique insights that helped align our efforts with those of our partners, ensuring we deliver exceptional value to the client 💼.

This collaborative effort wasn’t just about combining tools—it was about uniting people and ideas across five companies to achieve one common goal 🎯. 

A special thanks to everyone who lives the MACH Alliance values and contributed to these successful partnerships, proving once again that when we come together, we truly elevate the customer experience ✨.

This is the question I asked a few remarkable women in my team at HRS Group leading up to International Women’s Day.

Sharing their insights and learning is the essence of what  #IWD and female leadership mean to me:

🙌 Lifting each other up & cheering for one another
🙌 Challenging each other to grow beyond what we sometimes think is possible
🙌 Being mentors to young female leaders

Here are their answers:

🧩 ""Don’t get stuck in following THE plan.
Yes, of course, having a (career) plan and knowing what you want is important, but always stay open-minded for opportunities and change. Steps to the supposedly left or right are often the best prep for a step up. You will be surprised how the experience and skills you collect will puzzle together.""
Katharina Vater

🚀""Stay open and curious. Professional life is a constant learning curve, and there is always room for development. Specialize in your field and actively seek opportunities to acquire new skills. Dare to step outside your comfort zone to gain valuable experiences, although it may be intimidating at times. And don’t underestimate the importance of relationships in professional life. Nurture relationships with colleagues, superiors, and mentors. And ultimately: Don’t be too hard on yourself and do your best.""
Ruth Schuster

💪 ""Believe in yourself and don’t be intimidated by the fancy, big words of others. Dare to question!""
Maya Deim

🪂 “So far, no master fell out of the sky.
Authenticity is the key to personal success. Trust your strengths, but also have the courage to display your weaknesses and ask for help when needed. It is essential to remain curious, eager to learn, and continuously challenge yourself in order to grow. You have a long journey ahead of you, so make it a personal adventure and remain calm.""

🌏When I was little, growing up in a small town, I was told that the farthest place I could travel was Russia. So I joined a Russian club to get myself ready. After the wall came down, I learned more languages (English, Spanish, French) and have traveled 66 countries by now including Russia.

🎤As a teenager, I was told that I might not get to study despite my A grades because of my family's non-conformist views in communist East Germany. In 1988, my application to study international business was rejected, another reason why I took part in the peaceful revolution in 1989 joining my pharmacist dad speaking in front of thousands about environmental pollution in the GDR.

In 1990, I was among the first generation of students that joined a Western German university even before Germany was officially reunited. Later I used my business sense to work at world class international companies like Procter & Gamble, Merck, Google, Stada. Like my dad, I go on stages to speak up and ignite transformation. I am happy to support Yunus Social Business and Generation CEO to drive more of that for business and our society.

Surely besides being an exhibitor, that’s a different story.

I was actively visiting expos from late 90s and clearly see my three stages of visitor.

Stage 1 - Study. You visit all the lectures, shows and in between meeting someone you know or trying to randomly make new connections like in real life LinkedIn. You also visit all the expos you can.

Stage 2 - Communication. You visit some interesting lectures but mostly busy with making meaningful connection with people from specific areas. You also visit specific list of expos that you find the most helpful.

Stage 3 - Performance. You visit only the expos and conferences where you perform as a speaker. You may visit 1-2 of really interesting events cause your time is packed with meeting long before the event and you also get several dozen of new meetings after your speech and a hundred of new connections in the next couple of weeks. That’s a real stuff!

I miss this third stage now as I had to get back to Stage 2. But I will be back soon:)

Attending DMEXCO, even for just one day, filled with a wealth of people, stages, and insightful content. Here are my personal takeaways:

1. Retailers are Becoming Creative Powerhouses 🎨:
Retailers are increasingly adopting creative approaches in advertising. For exmaple the Amazon Brand Lab Innovation Team is offering customized landing pages and innovative campaign concepts creating new online beauty destinations for our consumers.

2. AI: Beyond the Buzzword 🤖:
""AI"" was everywhere, but scalable use cases remain elusive. Kapten & Son's refreshing pragmatism resonated deeply: ""Focus on your basics, check your P&L, and work on topics like retention. Don't neglect the trends, but decide how much you're willing to invest."" A much-needed dose of reality!

3. Navigating the Retail Media Maze 🧭: 
IAB Europe statistics painted a stark picture: 113 active Retail Media networks in EMEA (plus retail-like media networks) highlight the fragmentation. Key takeaways?

Embrace Existing Standards: No need to reinvent the wheel.
Diversify Revenue Streams: Think beyond placements – consulting, data, and insights 
Forge Strategic Partnerships: Team up with powerhouses like The Trade Desk, Criteo, and even connected TV platforms.

Masterclass Insights: Nadine Kamski & Franziska Eickhoff, along with Amazon's Ad Tech Lead DE Cyrus Zaboli, delivered an insightful masterclass on ""Insights to Impact."" They showcased how Amazon & L'Oréal go beyond advertising. 

Connected Departments = Powerful Insights: Ecommerce, media, and data teams working together unlock a whole new level of understanding.

Amazon Marketing Cloud = Actionable Results: Activating insights through targeted audiences delivers serious impact, especially for always-on campaigns.

#ViralBeauty = Scalable Success: We saw firsthand how Amazon's markteting cloud audiences can be leveraged even in the upper funnel, making advertising more measurable and effective

In 2016, I had been laid off from my first job at GoodService, luckily I met Abhinav and Rijul at GoodService. Both of them had joined this seed funded startup which they were all gaga about specially the culture and that it’s a Google partner. As a young fresher it excited me that I get to work with an organization which works with Google and I can align my career with something that Google does. No points for guessing it’s AdPushup. 

What really inspired me to join was the humble beginnings of the Founders. Ankit  and Atul, college drop outs from a business course were building a tech startup. 

I joined in as an associate for inside sales and wanted a 360 experience, in lieu of gaining experience to build a business eventually a few years later. To which Ankit said why don’t you run this organisation as your own. There were times wherein I felt like throwing in the towel but this vision inspired me. 

Cheers to the partners and our trusted customers throughout this journey. 

Throughout the pleasure of working with talented peers like Rijul Sharma Abhinav Choudhri, Anil Panghal Sahil Singh Sahil Gupta Aman Singhal Arun Michael Dsouza Sanjot Singh Rob S.   Shubham G  Subrat Tyagi Udit Jindal Shreyas Zare Christian Baer Vishveshwar Jatain Yomesh Gupta Zahin Akshay, Gurleen Baruah Aditi Banerjee, Ph.D Rahul Ranjan Himanshu Sharma Surbhi Goel Sachin Gulati Sukriti Leekha. Thanks for contributing to me throughout and making this journey enjoyable. 

Cheers, to the most special folks who contributed to the new business acquisition over the years, my team Yash Naidu Shashank Mudgal Parry M. Hitesh Datta Swapnil Shankar Shaunak Thakkar  who believed in the mission and reinvented themselves throughout this journey. 

A special mention to my mentors Sanjay Trehan and Dhiraj Singh thank you. 

Most importantly my wife Shreya and family, thanks for allowing me adopt AdPushup as a kid ;) 

Another milestone for the AdPushup family, stoked to be a part of the Geniee International Group  family and taking on a bigger global mission. Let’s go, now on to the next milestone.

48 crazy intensive hours
Several dozen coffees, beers and G&Ts
Hundreds of handshakes
Thousands new ideas!

Started off Tuesday at our partner agency morefire's client day event. Immediately Thorsten Olscha threw me in to their panel discussion on AI (KI in German, and Datenschutz is always an important topic in German)

Daniela Romberg introduced me to Timo Franz to talk about International digital marketing for a B2B2C client.
Dinner with morefire clients and friends - great to meet the people from B. Braun such as Janine P.!
Closing off the eve at VIA Nederland  drinks reception with 175 Dutchies, talking about Retail Media at HelloFresh with genius David Wijland ✔️ and getting to know Susanne Klabbers Personalized Video solution. Agreed with Richard Smoorenburg to catch up over beers Wednesday afternoon - but we forgot!

Day one of Dmexco - brilliant kick-off speech of Robin Heintze with his wisdom of B2B marketing that he wished he'd had 5 years ago.

Exploring many advertising-supported Video On Demand (ASVOD) solutions such as Disney Julia Schörner who have already 2M such subscribers in Germany.

Explosion of Retail Media solutions - Schwarz Corporate Solutions is moving super fast in this space. Well done Fabian Leitinger, Lidl Netherlands must be eagerly awaiting the roll-out here.

Lunch with Mitch Voskuilen & Milou Rengelink of our attribution & AI performance marketing solution Billy Grace (thanks for sponsoring OM Club and bringing us along!)

Meeting Ernst Dirkzwager of Readpeak - interesting solution, Ibro Karahasanović should we perhaps give this a chance with a test?

Adform's DSP seems to be doing really well in the cookieless era. Higher match rates for 1st party data and better across browsers (where DV360 might match audiences preferably within Chrome and Android). Thanks for the insights Katja Henneveld and Tessa Johanneke van den Dool.

Softies Matthijs van Heijningen (congrats on ten years Microsoft!) and Sabrina Schmidt - talking about their event next Monday where I'll be a panelist.

Meeting my old protégé Wicher Schapers who's now rocking it at skydreams with Vinícius Leão
Super effective Social tooling Smartly - happy to see our partnership manager Torsten Noack and discuss future growth. Shame I can't be at your event soon, but I'll make sure to send some colleagues :)

More more morefire with good friend Nick Zwar (enjoy your long break and good luck in future endeavours!) and Marcel Schrepel

Call Tracking in 2013? Not available in the Netherlands, but with Frank G. Froux of matelso GmbH we figured it out and brought it here. Great to see the developments your company has made to bring Marketing and Sales closer to eachother.

Day one of Dmexco a wrap? No no - the OM Club party at Bootshaus (#5 techno club in the world) was crazy good until after 3am 💀

Then the very cool blueMoon incubator space, Addis Garage, fiercely loved by startups across the city. Then the natural evolution to blueSpace, the top co-working space in Ethiopia which opened its doors 5 years ago and has grown massively from 400 to over 2000 sqm and 200+ desks.

7123248725908430848,"🇺🇸 What shocked me in the USA.

During my recent travels in the USA, I couldn't help but notice the differences in environmental awareness compared to some other places I've visited. While there's certainly progress and a growing movement towards sustainability, it's clear that environmental considerations might still have some catching up to do in certain areas of the country.

One noticeable aspect was the prevalence of plastic, reminding us of the ongoing challenges associated with single-use plastics. Additionally, there were very few electric cars on the roads, with Teslas being an exception.
I want to relate this to the Black Swan Theory.

The Black Swan Theory, popularized by author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is grounded in the idea that unpredictable and unexpected events, often referred to as ""black swans,"" have a profound impact on our lives and the world.

In this case, “Black swan"" means that the USA is not aware of what she is doing with her actions. This would mean that the people living there might end up on a garbage dump or poisoning themselves.

What are your thoughts? This isn't just a concern in the USA; many countries worldwide struggle with low environmental awareness. However, larger and more influential countries should serve as role models, don't you think?

Personally for me it was great attending this event with #Adchieve. Met a lot of interesting new people and existing clients, but also attended conferences and learned new stuff. To top if off we had an amazing party at the #Mediamarkt experience center.

Some key take aways from my side:
🔥 Performance Max #automation is The hot topic for e-commerce. Alex van de Pol presented how to maximize your profit, instead of Google's (DM or comment for more details)

🔥 More and more brands are discovering the potential by stepping in the #Metaverse space and how to use #NFTs to grow their brand. Thanks for the education Diego Borgo ᵍᵐ

🔥 Offline conferences are back in full force. It was great meeting you Gerald Böse, Jan Garnefeld and David Bargiel. Thanks for the organization and hosting.

- pierwszy raz za jego życia (78 lat) geopolityka ma tak duży wpływ na branżę reklamową

- dokładniej są to trzy czynniki ryzyka: konflikt USA-Chiny, wojna na Ukrainie, zagrożenie ze strony Iranu, które mają wpływ na decyzje gospodarcze

- jeśli kraj chce mieć silną gospodarkę, musi mieć silne firmy technologiczne

- siła branży tech może być ważna także dla wyników wyborów - jeśli gospodarka będzie miała dobre parametry, w USA ponownie wygra Biden

- budżety reklamowe w coraz większym stopniu trafiają do kluczowych platform tech, ale reklamodawcy powinni próbować odzyskać nad nimi kontrolę

- w ciagu dwóch lat zacznie się  redukcja liczby mediaplanerow potrzebnych w branży reklamowej z uwagi na powszechne wykorzystanie do tego celu AI

- przewaga AI polega m.in. na szybkości (natychmiastowości) współdzielenia informacji, międzyludzka komunikacja zajmuje dużo więcej czasu

7041497665221632000,"I do cringe for a SaaS. 🙃

Let's face it, being a SaaS company on social media is tricky and sometimes can feel like squeezing a marathon into a 30-second video.

And while TikTok may seem like a strange place for a B2B company to be, we decided to give it a shot. 

After some trial and error, we managed to grow our account to over 11K followers, it may not seem much in the grand scheme of this platform, but it's honest work.

Now, I admit some of our early attempts at TikTok content made me cringe myself. And I'm not talking about the good kind of cringe, like when you watch a cheesy '80s movie. I'm talking about the kind of cringe where you want to bury your head in the sand and pretend it never happened. 🫣

But here's the thing: we're a SaaS company, but we're also made up of real humans with personalities and a sense of humor.

💭 And that's why I greatly respect companies that take a risk and inject some humor into their brand. It's not easy to walk that fine line between funny and cringe-worthy, but when it works, it really works. And it doesn't mean the company is any less professional or serious about what they do.

So, if you see a SaaS company on TikTok trying to be funny and falling flat, don't judge them too harshly. 

They're just trying to navigate a new frontier and connect with their audience in a more relatable way. And hey, maybe they'll even make you laugh along the way. 😂          

P.S. What's not cringe over there is solely due to the coolest teammates out there, Rebeca Gruie and Răzvan Hercuț. 🙌
It's like they're the life of the party, and I get to tag along for the ride.

Firstly… Slovenia is an outstandingly beautiful place - the landscape, the people, the food, the wine… it has it all 😍

Secondly, the team at Red Orbit know how to put on an event 🥳

The meticulous planning that goes into this event is evident.

The speakers were amazing company to be recognised amongst. 

Highlight sessions included Joao Adao, Azeem Ahmad, Heather Physioc and Greg Gifford, to mention just a few.

The way Andraž Štalec and his team look after the speakers is second to none.

The camaraderie between the speakers was brilliant - some of us were friends ahead of the day, many were first introductions - but we all left as friends, keen to stay in touch ❤️

My talk was on using behavioural science to master your customer journey. 

I found likeness in a number of the talks - moving towards a more human approach, which for me is critical to a successful strategy.

👇🏻 I have linked my slides below 👇🏻

I was also invited to join a 🔥 fireside chat 🔥 hosted by Robert Craven with Ann Stanley (aka Simmonds) and Valentina Pirih to talk about managing clients.

We covered everything from the good, how to make things amazing and what to do when relationships are tested. 

I absolutely love a panel - it is always so interesting to see what others have to say and bounce ideas off of each other in front of an audience. 

Whilst I was there it was also the inaugural inObit awards - where I was a judge and invited to reveal some of the winners.

I practised my words over and over again… Slovenian is not the easiest language to pronounce for my British tongue 😬😂

It was fabulous to see such worthy winners celebrate their hard work ❤️

I hope the organising team have had a well deserved restful weekend.

No doubt they are already debriefing and starting to plan their 2025 event. 

Watch this space… I would highly recommend attending 👀

7061716558309388288,"MCC announces next stage of improvements at Lord’s Cricket Ground

Marylebone Cricket Club has announced that London-based practice, WilkinsonEyre, has been appointed as architect for the redevelopment of the Tavern and Allen Stands at Lord’s Cricket Ground.

The project is the latest in the programme of facilities upgrades at the Home of Cricket, as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) continues to improve the match day experience of MCC Members and visitors alike.

The Tavern Stand will be stripped back to its underlying steel framework, to enable the stand to be extended and completely rebuilt, while the smaller Allen Stand (parts of which date from the 1930s) will be demolished and a new building constructed in its place.

The appointment of WilkinsonEyre, which was made following a design competition, extends their successful working relationship with MCC, established through the design and delivery of the Compton and Edrich stands. The largest construction project in the Club’s history was completed for the 2021 cricket season and the resulting stands provide integrated facilities while increasing the seating capacity by 2,600.

With sustainability and inclusivity at the forefront of the redevelopment, the Compton and Edrich stands were recently the recipient of a coveted Civic Trust Award, given to projects that make an outstanding contribution to the quality and appearance of the built environment.

As well as WilkinsonEyre, MCC will work with its principal consultants: Arcadis, Buro Happold and Gardiner & Theobald LLP, over the course of the redevelopment project.

Auf der Messe hatte ich den perfekten Moment: Ein Foto mit einem Schild im Hintergrund, das wie ein Heiligenschein über mir schwebt. Eine passende Metapher, um meine Erfahrungen dieses Jahr zu teilen:

📉 Wahrnehmungen:
Die Messe scheint immer kleiner zu werden – weniger Aussteller, weniger Fläche (subjektive Wahrnehmung).
Besonders im tertiären Bereich, bei den Marketing-Dienstleistern, ist die Pipeline wohl eher dünn.
Unter vorgehaltener Hand hört man oft: „So schlecht lief es noch nie.“
Auch bei den Software-Plattformen scheinen die Akquise-Pipelines nicht mehr so gefüllt wie früher.

🤔 Subjektiv:
Ein struktureller Wandel? Während die #OMR2024 voller Leben war, scheint die DMEXCO an Glanz verloren zu haben.
Früher war mir der Termin im Kalender fast heilig, doch jetzt frage ich mich: Ist das nur noch Schein?

7242859989164277761,"🌟 Insights von der DMEXCO 2024 🌟

Ein aufregender Tag DMEXCO zusammen mit Michael Fischer und Nina Werner liegt hinter mir. Ein paar meiner wichtigsten Learnings:

💡 Kontext ist King: Gen Z will nicht nur Produkte, sondern die Geschichten dahinter.
💡 Modernes Marketing: Echter Marketing-Erfolg entsteht durch das Zusammenspiel von Skills und Technologie.
💡 Omnichannel Integration: Bleibt häufig eine Herausforderung – der Loop ist noch nicht ganz geschlossen.

Für KNISTR  am Wichtigsten:

🚀 Retail Media war mit einer ganzen Halle vertreten und ist vielleicht die Zukunft der Werbung. Es wird erwartet, dass Retail Media bald 20 % der globalen digitalen Advertising Spends ausmacht. Von Awareness bis Conversion – jeder Bereich des Marketing Funnels kann durch den Zugang des Handels gezielt bedient werden. Das revolutioniert Geschäftsmodelle im Retail und schafft neue Perspektiven. 

🔑 Loyalty-Programme spielen bei Retail Media eine Schlüsselrolle: Sie ermöglichen den Zugang zu wertvollen Kundendaten und schaffen überhaupt die Grundlage für zielgerichtete, personalisierte Werbung. Unternehmen wie Amazon, Walmart und in Deutschland speziell Schwarz, OBI, Douglas & REWE nutzen Loyalty-Daten, um Retail Media-Strategien zu stärken und ihre Werbeeffizienz zu steigern. Also: Loyalty-Programme sind der Enabler, der Retail Media so kraftvoll macht!

😄 Und ganz persönlich? Die DMEXCO fühlte sich fast wie ein Klassentreffen an – bunt, erlebnisreich und voller spannender Begegnungen, gerade auch was Partnering betrifft. Die Fahrt mit dem Autoscooter auf der Messe war definitiv die perfekte Abwechslung!

7245744782151438336,"The Armenia Digital Awards 2024 by ECDMA  and Digital & Ecomm EVN Conference are now behind us. It's a mix of emotions – happiness for what we achieved, but also a bit of sadness that it’s almost over. What's left is preparing press releases, delivering awards to those who couldn't attend, analyzing our mistakes, and figuring out the future of these events.

Some people have asked, ""How much did you earn?"" If we’re talking money, the answer is simple – I earned a significant amount, just with a minus sign in front of it (or as some like to call it, ""substantial negative growth"") 😄. But I see it as an investment. An investment in the development of Armenia's market and community.

Thanks to these events, I got to meet so many incredible people – people who are great to talk to about life and work, people who are ready to help without expecting anything in return, even offering their support before being asked. These are people with whom I’m sure we’ll create many more projects together.

The conference, which Artak Harutyunyan  (so glad we met and became partners) and I organized from scratch in just a two weeks, saw an incredible turnout. I’ve never seen a conference in Yerevan where, 40 minutes before the start, the hall was already half full. At one point, we had around 200 attendees simultaneously, and considering the flow of people coming and going, there were over 280 participants in total. These are incredible numbers!

The speakers were highly professional, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the audience was actively engaging, not just scrolling on their phones.

Yes, there were some surprising challenges along the way – the low engagement from agencies (globally, agencies are typically the main participants, submitting their client work), the hesitation from sponsors, the lack of interest from ministries, and the reluctance of voters to leave written feedback on government services (even though they have plenty to say in person). But these are minor setbacks – we'll make it even better next time.

These were my first events where I was the lead organizer. Sure, I’ve often spoken at conferences and been involved in the setup in my corporate life, but this was different.

6 années pendant lesquelles je me suis enrichie et j’ai grandi.
6 années de moments inoubliables, de bienveillance et de partage.
6 années et voilà qu’il est temps pour moi de tourner cette page, de prendre mon envol, de voler de mes propres ailes. 

Comme dans une rupture amoureuse, c’est le cœur lourd que j’ai décidé de mettre un point final au chapitre Or en Cash. 

🙏 Merci à Christophe Gerber et Valérie Gerber qui ont su m’accorder leur confiance, merci à toutes les personnes formidables avec lesquelles j’ai eu la chance de travailler. 

“C’est pas toi, c’est moi”, phrase bateau que vous avez peut-être entendu dans un autre contexte, mais qui représente tout à fait ce qui a animé cette décision. 

🔎 Pour les plus observateurs d’entre vous, vous aurez remarqué que le titre de mon profil LinkedIn a changé. “Entrepreneuse”, terme vaste qui définit désormais l’aventure dans laquelle je me lance.

📣 Un nouveau cycle commence pour moi, celui de l'entreprenariat. 

💡 Indice 💡 
Qu’est ce qui a fait échouer votre dernière relation de couple ? Vous avez certainement eu une longue discussion à ce sujet avec votre ex. 

💬 Qu’est ce qui fera à coup sûr échouer votre relation avec votre futur collaborateur ? La réponse n’aurait-elle pas des similitudes avec celle de la question précédente ?

🗓 Si j’ai piqué votre curiosité je vous donne rendez-vous en septembre pour découvrir et vivre à mes côtés, pas à pas, ce nouveau voyage. 

Bel été à tous 🏖

Here are some key highlights from the panel:

🌟 Optimism around AI is strong—it's here to stay. We must embrace it and continue to educate ourselves further

👤 Adopt intelligent AI solutions that act as human as possible, bridging the necessary gap. Mantis suite of solutions analyses data with human-like precision, understanding tone, sentiment, and the true context of each page

💡 Senior leaders should adopt AI more actively, as over-reliance at entry levels can lead to an ill-educated workforce

🚀 AI is for everyone, it’s essential to leverage it to boost productivity and remove mundane tasks, but the human touch remains crucial
 
❗ Understand and be aware how your IP might be helping to train LLM, so you can adjust your strategy accordingly

Ci abbiamo sempre riso sopra quando ci siamo ritrovati a parlarne, perché effettivamente è una parte del mio lavoro ma odio questa definizione… è terribilmente incompleta. 

In un mercato così saturo di system integrator, provider di ogni genere, rivenditori dell’ultima ora e sedicenti professionisti dai Job Title improbabili, non è semplice spiegare in maniera rapida e concreta il mio lavoro a chi non conosce me e l’azienda per cui lavoro. 

Mi sono impegnato quindi in questo esercizio: mettere per iscritto “cosa fa” MMN - Magnetic Media Network S.p.A. Con l’obiettivo di essere sintetico e chiaro (e perchè no, di tirar fuori un “testo tipo” per fare un po’ di hunting di nuovi clienti🥳)

Ed eccoci qua…
COS’È MMN?
È un Solutions Provider in ambito IT da 35 anni.

COS’È UN SOLUTION PROVIDER?
Solutions: SOLUZIONI
Provider: FORNITORE

CHE TIPO DI SOLUZIONI? QUAL’È IL PERIMETRO IN CUI OPERA?
Attraverso un approccio basato sui propri valori (Onestà, Positività, Umanità e Passione) MMN agisce su quattro “pillars”:

- Deployment & Employee Chioce:  forniamo ed integriamo il miglior hardware disponibile sul mercato e offriamo soluzioni EMM/MDM che permettono la distribuzione su larga scala, il setup e la messa in sicurezza dei dispositivi in modo automatizzato. Mettiamo l’IT, il finance e l’HR dei nostri clienti nelle condizioni di permettere ai dipendenti di scegliere la piattaforma preferita con cui lavorare.

-Spatial Computing: sviluppiamo ecosistemi di app (per Apple Vison Pro e non solo) per introdurre nelle aziende questo nuovo paradigma.

-Digital transformation: sviluppiamo app custom per digitalizzare i processi (turnazioni, documentali, check-list coprorate). 

-Zero Impact IT Project: annulliamo l’impatto carbonico delle flotte IT (certificazione ICMQ) ed affianchiamo le aziende nelle iniziative di salvaguardia del pianeta. 

LAVORATE CON DEI PARTNER?
MMN | StartApps | Apple | Lenovo | Jamf | VMware Workspace ONE | Rete Clima  e altri. 

Quindi, si! Come spesso accade (😅) la mia famiglia in parte ha ragione: vendiamo ANCHE telefoni

And hey, share it with your colleagues and friends who might have missed this great resource because sharing is caring. https://lnkd.in/gHxdHVNP

🎮 Below are my top tips for Chinajoy:
1. Registering for a WeChat account in advance is recommended, as many events require WeChat mini-program registration for convenience. Additionally, WeChat is commonly used for communication within the gaming industry in China.
2. During CJ, getting a taxi near the exhibition hall might be relatively difficult, and the waiting time is usually long. If you have transportation needs, it is advisable to allow enough time between meetings.
Shanghai's end of July is a very hot week, so please take precautions against sunburn and heatstroke.
3. Cash is not commonly needed in China nowadays, so setting up Alipay/WeChat Pay accounts in advance is convenient.

I am very much looking forward to the opportunity for studio leadership from around the world to catch up with us.! 💗

1 - Wear comfortable shoes!! There is ALOT walking
2 - Download the APP and USE it - this is one of the BEST conference apps out there
3 - TALK to everyone. Don't be shy. (Almost) everyone wants to network (there is always someone who just doesn't like to interact at EVERY conference. Move on in this case ;)
4 - Get yourself the after party. It's always fun, good networking plus, as the article says, this year it has REALLY been revamped (which is good as last year they had a bugee jump in the parking lot. After all the drinks i'm not too sure how good an idea this was...!)

was a recurring theme for me this year. 

First, I had the pleasure in taking the stage at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference in Germany, where I shared insights on creating a storytelling powerhouse with AI x webinars.

Creating AI-powered visuals has become a passion. 

So many ideas, so many tools, so many creative directions. 

Connecting webinars to these visuals is all about scaling your storytelling and creating sustainable reach. I believe this will be big for B2B/B2C marketing.

Earlier this month, I revisited the contents of this talk in 'The Webinarverse', the yearly online event hosted by WebinarGeek. Hundreds of people enjoyed talks by Leonardo.Ai, Jordie van Rijn 💙💛, Kareem Mostafa and PwC.

With the last months of 2024 before us, I can't wait for 2025 and see what new doors it will open for AI-powered storytelling.

While I was lucky enough to meet so many fascinating people on behalf of 
Forever Audio, I was also inspired by the cutting-edge innovations and ideas shared throughout the event.
🔊AI & Audio Innovation took center stage, with discussions on how AI is transforming audio creation - from personalised ads to dynamic soundscapes, offering new ways to scale and tailor audio experiences.
🎙The importance of Sonic Branding was also a major theme, emphasising sound’s power in building emotional connections and creating memorable brand identities.
🎧With advancements in Immersive Audio, brands are now able to create captivating, 3D sound experiences for gaming, VR, and live events, setting a new standard for audience engagement.

Overall, the future of audio is brighter than ever, and #DMEXCO2024 was an exciting glimpse into what’s next! 🎤💡

From conversations with so many credible industry voices to the giddy buzz around all things AI, it felt like taking a glimpse at the future of the advertising world. Now returning to an everyday normal, I couldn't help but marvel at just how tectonic the shifts are in terms of how we are really looking at the evolution of our landscape. AI is not simply a game-changer, it is the ultimate edge we have in an infinite game that no longer hinges on who wins but on who innovates and collaborates with this technology to sustain us in a near-perfect state of excellence as we evolve. Betting big on this wave that's about to sweep ad-tech, we're stoked to be part of a world that is not 'AI' or 'ME' but rather 'AI + ME'.

Having endured three change in control (Blackstone and KKR most recently) and six M&A's, its time for a hiatus.  Therefore, I am planning to take 3 months off and resurface in the November timeframe.  I will be entertaining any opportunities in mid to late October.  

Accuvant/Optiv was a great run that afforded me the opportunity to grow immensely as a sales leader and sales executive, while giving me the  distinct pleasure of having worked with wonderful, talented people.  I will miss the friendship and camaraderie.  Additionally, I am thankful to the client base and vendor community that has supported me and my business these past years.   Whatever lies ahead for me certainly will involve many of you.

For now, I will be focussed on running the local AYSO chapter for the Fall..could be tougher than dealing with PE firms :-)  I look forward to resuming my career in a few months.

It's a wrap on DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference 2024. 

We loved catching up with so many partners and friends in Cologne, while hearing about the latest technologies set to shake up the ad tech space in 2025.

Our top takeaways are:

👕 Retail Media is booming: With IAB Europe expecting retail media sales to reach 13.8 billion euros in Europe alone this year, it’s no surprise that the sector is exploding. Compelling case studies showcased its ability to drive brand awareness while achieving real business outcomes.

🍪 Everyone’s talking about Google: Google’s cookie u-turn has ironically sparked a lot of conversations about cookieless solutions for the future. First-party data strategies are quickly being adopted across the industry, with consumers playing a significant role in driving this change.

🤖 AI AI AI: Industry players discussed how artificial intelligence opens up new opportunities to generate content at scale, enabling hyper-personalised customer experiences, and how it can be leveraged to counter threats such as misinformation and deep fakes.

7194341020845699072,"One of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world didn't officially attend RSA Conference this year. 
 
""Officially"" 
 
Palo Alto Networks created a lot of chatter by not doing things the official way. 
 
I thought about covering the AI event itself, but (to me, a business nerd) their marketing strategy is the interesting part. 
 
I feel like it might end up being sneaky effective. Here's why: 
 
→ An online event reaches buyers who didn't attend the conference (most of them). 
 
""An online event during the week of RSAC? Whaaaaa??!!"" Yeah, seems wild at first, but it's more rational than you'd think. 
 
RSAC draws ~40-50,000 people, and a lot of them work for product or services companies.  They were too busy to attend — but from a numbers standpoint, they're the minority.  
 
There are more buyers working their normal cybersecurity jobs this week than attending the conference (including most of my practitioner colleagues – all senior leaders – who don't attend regularly). 
 
An online event during a week where basically nobody else is doing online events can reach a lot of people. 
 
→ Who said an exhibit has to be a booth or a keynote? 
 
This is what marketing looks like when you deeply question constraints. They're ""exhibiting"" without actually exhibiting. 
 
If you've been to enough conferences, you've seen hundreds of exhibitor booths. How many of them do you remember? Maybe like two. 
 
But if you were in San Francisco, you're probably going to remember the time Palo Alto Networks flew a drone show over the Embarcadero at night and put Keanu Reeves in one of their ads. 
 
→ Different gets people talking. 
 
This wasn't about ignoring the conference. It was about being different than all the other companies who were at the conference. 
 
It's harder than ever to stand out at RSAC. But whether you were there or not, there's a good chance you talked about Palo Alto Networks this week. 
 
They got me to spend two hours thinking about their strategy for free, and this post will probably have five-figure views on LinkedIn. ""Different"" works when it's done well. 
 
--- 
 
In hindsight, this stunt by Palo Alto Networks may or may not end up being a hit. That's the thing about marketing (or any creative work) – it's really hard to predict what's going to land or get mocked (or both!). 
 
Worst case, I think they've done something memorable that's going to carry over into a longer-term brand campaign after the conference.  
 
Best case, I think they've changed the model for big company marketing at RSAC. We'll see!",,2024-05-09T14:22:43.741Z,no,no,"The post date is 2024-05-09, which is before the event date of DMEXCO 2024 (September 18, 2024). Therefore, the post is not related to the DMEXCO 2024 event."

Here's my hot take: 

🧗♀️ Fragmentation and lack of standardization are major hurdles that need to be overcome to achieve scale. 

🔑 Standardization is key for reaching the right audience and leveraging data effectively.

📷 Incorporating more video content into campaigns is one way brands can move further up the marketing funnel, capturing a wider audience earlier in their decision-making process. 

📊 Proving the effectiveness of retail media remains a challenge but ultimately, accurate measurement and result reporting are essential for adapting strategies and meeting stakeholder expectations.

📈 Remaining focused and using standardized audience segmentation and custom segments can help target crucial brand KPIs. 

Retail media is evolving, and overcoming these challenges will be crucial for its continued growth, scaling and impact.

7226108421001854977,"Be cautious with the term #Influencer. There are certain sensitivities associated with it. #Creator sounds much better. More creative, less commercial, less of an unwanted influence. 

As influencers become creators, the rules of the entire industry are changing. It is at an inflection point. Every marketer now knows that creators are an integral part of every media plan. Around 𝟒𝟎% 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐒𝐀 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐛𝐮𝐝𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐬 for this in 2024, according to the IAB. 

The trend is moving towards campaigns with 𝐟𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬. While most brands were still working with 11 to 20 creators per campaign in 2021, the majority of brands reduced the number of creators to up to five in 2023. However, the number of campaigns is increasing, and the focus is on long-term relationships. 

At the same time, the number of creators has never been as large. In the USA, there are an 𝟐𝟕 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚, according to a study by The Keller Advisory Group. That's 14% of consumers between the ages of 16 and 54. 

This shows the competition and the saturation of the market. Especially in the medium and small influencer segment - I need a synonym for a change - price negotiations should be easy. 

In Germany, a recent study confirms another interesting turning point. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞. The study looked at the proportion of people who followed recommendations from YouTube or Instagram stars. In 2023, it was 37% and 33% respectively. This year, it fell to 29% for both channels for the first time. 

𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐮𝐩. Influencer marketing is seen rationally and taken very seriously at the same time.This also means that influencer activation is now planned, controlled and then monitored and reported just like any other channel.

Influencers are media - and that's what makes it so complicated. Because they are also individuals who only show their real strength when you look at them individually and let go of the reins.

Marketers probably roll their eyes when they hear this question. I often feel the same way. 

The problem? We often don't speak the same language across teams.
The solution? We need to break down the silos we work in.
And how? Marie-Therese, Britta, Thomas, and I will discuss this on Thursday at DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference.

It's crazy how time flies. Tomorrow we're off to Cologne. So excited!

1️⃣ Not defining a buyer persona

It is easy to set up a Google Ads campaign within a few minutes. Therefore, it can be tempting to rush the launch of your B2B marketing campaign. Without a well-thought-out strategy, you risk not fully exploiting the potential and wasting the advertising budget.

Think carefully about who you want to target with your ads. With personas, you give your target group a face. This gives you new perspectives and impulses that you can consider when planning your Google Ads campaign.

2️⃣ Sending PPC traffic to the homepage

It is unlikely that the home page will meet the user expectation after clicking on your ad, primarily since the design of your homepage is not geared towards getting visitors to complete a conversion such as a contact request.

3️⃣ Lack of conversion tracking

Many advertisers do not use conversion tracking or do not have a well-thought-out tracking concept.

Tip: Link Google Ads to your CRM. By linking Google Ads to your CRM system, you provide additional data points to the bidding algorithm. 

You can use the ""maximise conversion value"" bidding strategy to optimize your campaigns to generate more and better leads.

4️⃣ Focusing on bottom of funnel keywords

The advantage of advertising on lower-funnel keywords is that you address users about to make a purchase decision. This advantage becomes a disadvantage at the same time: The search volume for transactional search queries is limited, and competition is tough.

Many B2B marketers find it challenging to overcome the limitations of transactional search queries— the result: High click prices and low conversion rates. Especially if you have a small advertising budget, this means that you don't collect enough conversion data to leverage the potential of smart bidding and automation fully.

A cost-effective method of addressing the entire customer journey is the SEE-THINK-DO-CARE framework. With Google Ads, you can target potential customers along the customer journey with appropriate content.

5️⃣ Not running Remarketing Ads

The B2B customer journey is by no means linear. Account-based marketing and remarketing play an essential role in the B2B marketing mix. 

According to Dreamdata the average B2B customer journey takes 192 days from first touch to deal.

Yet few advertisers use remarketing as part of their Google Ads strategy.

41% of B2B decision-makers consume three to five pieces of content before contacting a salesperson.

Tip: Target users who have already interacted with your company through remarketing ads. People familiar with a brand are more likely to trust it and pay more attention to its ads.

7109977733815771136,"I am sitting on a train to #dmexco in Cologne.

Why am I going to a marketing and eCommerce conference to talk about blockchain?

One reason is that Holger Nießner told me I should stop eating cake with developers at Blockchain Week Berlin and start onboarding real brands to CENT's newest blockchain powered Shopify plugin.

Another reason is that blockchain will disrupt marketing and eCommerce in yet unseen ways. 

Imagine users being able to decide where and how they want to get reached.

Imagine users being able to decide which artefacts of their history as consumers – think: music, fashion, shows, trips, donations, restaurant visits – they want to be associated with online.
 
The evolution from users being the data product to users owning their data is a win-win scenario for both brands and consumers. It will come. And the shift will be massive.

We’re looking forward to exploring that future at #dmexco with brands and thought leaders like Sennheiser SNIPES C&A OTTO Ford Motor Company Esprit Huawei TUI GALERIA Karstadt Kaufhof GmbH L'Oréal Spotify Škoda Auto SCHIESSER GmbH adidas Samsung Electronics and many more.

Thanks to our clients who have given us the opportunity, thanks to the datafuelX team for your amazing contributions. I can't wait to see what this team accomplishes next. ","As we approach St. Patrick's Day, marking datafuelX's third anniversary, we reflect on our journey from the kernel of an idea to a thriving adtech company. This milestone is a testament to our founding team's vision and relentless dedication, which fueled the creation of our flagship M3 platform.

Our narrative took a decisive turn with the rise of multiple currencies. This pivotal moment emphasized the urgent need for new ad metrics paradigms, a domain where our proficiency in advanced planning and forecasting methodologies truly excelled.

Transforming from an ambitious concept to a reality, M3 has redefined industry standards, especially with its adoption by TelevisaUnivision, showcasing our team's creativity and the platform's significance. Such innovations earned us a spot on Business Insider's 16 hottest adtech companies of 2023, alongside partnerships with giants like Hallmark Media, Scripps, The Weather Channel, and A+E Networks.

As 2024 unfolds, we're excited to welcome two new publishers, further expanding our impact. This journey, more than growth, is a story of unity and transformation driven by our belief in changing the advertising landscape.
