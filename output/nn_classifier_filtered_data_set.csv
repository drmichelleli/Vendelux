Event planners LOVE content.

Whenever I've been presenting about how events are content machines, the nodding in the room goes wild.

'Julius, nodding? Is that it?'

Of course not.

Boldpush research says that 75% of event professionals repurpose content.

To add more, the second largest category of eventtech by spend is content management. Boldpush research also says.

I shared it before: a one-hour session = 121 insights.

This incredible content production can be:

- The social media content for months.
- The video marketing that converts attendees.
- The upsell to a content hub
- The email collection tactic to beef up your database.

It will also provide the data to inform you about the content you'll bring to the show floor at the next event.

If you have an AV team on site, I'll be personally angry with you if you don't capture that content.

You can make this happen.

Are you capturing content this year?

The lazy, hazy days of summer are officially over. As the school bells ring and children return to their classrooms, the business world is also gearing up for a new season. Just as students swap flip-flops for trainers and backpacks, I’ve swapped my beach towel for a laptop and forecasting meetings!

September marks the end of the ""dog days of summer,"" but as the leaves begin to change colour and the temperature drops, for me there is a renewed sense of energy and purpose filling the air. 

Much like for those returning to school, the start of September brings with it a feeling of anticipation and excitement. September is a pivotal month in my business year.  We see a huge increase in events, trade shows, new marketing campaigns, the pressures to end the quarter strongly and for many the start to the frantic run up to the Q4 peak.  

For me, the lethargy of summer is all but a distant memory and the hyper active, hyper focused run into the end of the year has begun.  Last week I attended #SeamlessEurope where I joined a panel discussing the impact of predictive analytics on business and marketing execution.  This week we are hosting the Similarweb Annual Sales Leaders dinner in London where we will be discussing 'No nonsense AI: How Sales teams can use AI to create more value and less noise.  The team then moves quickly to #DMexco Cologne, SBC Summit Lisbon (#SBCEvents), and we are hosting what will be a fascinating webinar outlining Digital Cost Efficiency in Retail on Thursday 26th.

The dog days of summer may be behind us, but the best is yet to come.

7245744782151438336,"The Armenia Digital Awards 2024 by ECDMA  and Digital & Ecomm EVN Conference are now behind us. It's a mix of emotions – happiness for what we achieved, but also a bit of sadness that it’s almost over. What's left is preparing press releases, delivering awards to those who couldn't attend, analyzing our mistakes, and figuring out the future of these events.

Some people have asked, ""How much did you earn?"" If we’re talking money, the answer is simple – I earned a significant amount, just with a minus sign in front of it (or as some like to call it, ""substantial negative growth"") 😄. But I see it as an investment. An investment in the development of Armenia's market and community.

Thanks to these events, I got to meet so many incredible people – people who are great to talk to about life and work, people who are ready to help without expecting anything in return, even offering their support before being asked. These are people with whom I’m sure we’ll create many more projects together.

The conference, which Artak Harutyunyan  (so glad we met and became partners) and I organized from scratch in just a two weeks, saw an incredible turnout. I’ve never seen a conference in Yerevan where, 40 minutes before the start, the hall was already half full. At one point, we had around 200 attendees simultaneously, and considering the flow of people coming and going, there were over 280 participants in total. These are incredible numbers!

The speakers were highly professional, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the audience was actively engaging, not just scrolling on their phones.

Yes, there were some surprising challenges along the way – the low engagement from agencies (globally, agencies are typically the main participants, submitting their client work), the hesitation from sponsors, the lack of interest from ministries, and the reluctance of voters to leave written feedback on government services (even though they have plenty to say in person). But these are minor setbacks – we'll make it even better next time.

These were my first events where I was the lead organizer. Sure, I’ve often spoken at conferences and been involved in the setup in my corporate life, but this was different. The adrenaline is something I already crave more of, and I completely understand people in the event industry – always exhausted, but never giving up.

Thank you to everyone who helped, participated, and attended. Thank you to the jury, the press, new and old friends, and my family.

I’ll write a few more thoughtful posts later, but for now, it’s all emotions – apologies for the long read.

Thank you Ryan D. Taylor and Taj Ahmad Eldridge for hosting the Diverse Climate Tech Eco-System event. I left feeling inspired and motivated by the sweet community of people I met there! Environments that reflect the world affirm that representation matters and it is up to us to create the spaces we want to see in the world. 🧡  It also sounds like Energy is a hot investment these days~

Carbon Newbie Summit hosted by Michelle Li was a blast! I learned that professionals who have experience working in the climate space still feel like newbies since the industry is rapidly changing with new research, innovation, and policies. You can view speaker details, stream the event recording, and calculate your carbon footprint at carbonnewbie.com, but here are just a few of the many interesting highlights:

>The average American emits ~15 tons of CO2 per capita a year...the global average is 6.3 tons. 

>Emails: Send links to folders vs. attach files because a normal email is .3g CO2e and attachments are upwards 50g CO2e.

>Private Jets are 5 -14x more polluting per passenger than commercial flights.

>PPM = parts per million (#/1million air particles)
*Pre-industrial levels we were at 280ppm of CO2
*As of March, we are at 427.0 ppm of CO2
*Scientists say we should not surpass 450ppm of CO2
We have work to do!

>Allbirds is changing the footwear and apparel space by labeling every product with the amount of carbon it took to produce. Michelle said, ""We see calories for our food but we really don't see [carbon label measurements]"". It reminded me of a brainstorming conversation I had with my Climatebase fellow María Fernanda L.! Wouldn't it be awesome if we could access that information when we shop? I believe it would motivate greener decisions for brands and consumers. Jeanne Hartshorn is working on it with other fellows, I'm excited to see how it goes!

Make it customer-driven
Make it happen
Make it better 
Make it together 

Here are quotes from my teammates on the impact GKO had on them and why everyone is fired up even more:

""This feels more like a President Club trip than a Kickoff. I'm so fired up.""

""This is best work trip of my life. I love the culture and identity we are building.""

""That was a stellar GKO. The best one yet.""

""I've never been so inspired to work at a company. That was truly incredible.""

""This was a great opportunity to bring together the entire GTM organization globally and learn how our customers are leveraging the Glean platform to transform their business.""

""We have an amazingly talented team that gives each other grace for support and collective grit to push and grow across GTM, ENG, R+D.""

""A huge thank you to my Glean team, whose perfect blend of heart, execution, and customer obsession makes achievements like this possible. Here's to many more milestones together!""

""The energy and excitement here is second to none and I'm excited to see all that we accomplish as an org in the second half of this year!""

And many, many more that I can't fit in this message 😁 ","Spent the week in Tahoe for GKO with Glean and couldn’t be more fired up for what we have in store!

I was fortunate enough to bond with colleagues across all departments and from different parts of the world.

We discussed the importance of visual communication to accelerate business growth. It was great to share our successful journey and it is incredible to see our partners flourish and see the impact and value of Canva across their teams.,"🌟 What an amazing experience! 🌟

Today, I had the privilege of co-hosting a Masterclass at DMEXCO with our trusted partner, Canva  🎉

Our journey in the global talent attraction team started with a small pilot, and it blossomed into a powerful tool for implementing our Employer Brand on a global scale. We uncovered the astounding fact that visual content is 40 times more likely to be remembered, highlighting just how crucial a strong Employer Brand is to attract top talent and how a graphic Design Platform like Canva can support that.

But here’s the kicker: while it may sound like a simple topic, anyone in the field knows that real, long-term success doesn’t come from shortcuts. It comes from testing, refining, and testing again. There’s no magic formula – just hard work, data, and a commitment to improving the user experience, because at the end of the day, that’s what keeps customers coming back. 🔄

At the heart of CRO is making your customers feel valued, making it easy for them to engage, and ensuring their experience is smooth as butter. And guess what? That never goes out of style! 🧈✨

Onward to more testing, more optimizing, and more customer success stories! 🎉

Home. Do you know that feeling that after 7+ years of being an expat you finally “feel home”? What does “home” even mean? Is it this abstract thing where your feelings of belonging are through the roof as you wander along the streets of the city? 

Home. Utopical place, where you can breathe freely and you get an immediate sense of belonging.

Home. Home. Home… never felt like this in the dark & dirty city of Berlin.

I hate the nationalism that has ruined my once beloved country.

I am accepted here no matter my character.

✨ Imagine an event that seamlessly brings together the Marketing and Tech industries. Well, DMEXCO - Digital Marketing Expo & Conference is even more than that! Every September, Cologne-Germany transforms into a vibrant hub of innovation, discovery, networking, and of course, fun times together.

🎤 Last week, I had the privilege of joining another DMEXCO, returning as a speaker. I joined the IAB Europe - Attitudes for programmatic panel alongside industry colleagues like 💫 Cadi Jones, 💫 Carol Starr, 💫 Schwab Ingo, and 💫 Wayne Tassie. We delved into compelling conversations around why programmatic investments keep growing year on year, the key drivers of programmatic, and reflecting on third-party cookies alternatives.

🚀 DMEXCO is the ultimate destination for inspiration. I immersed myself in sessions on the New Era of Search, Generative AI, Retail Media, Gaming, Programmatic, and more. Two days of intense learning from the best in the field, making it the premier event to get inspired and educated on the latest trends.

🤝 But it’s not just about the sessions. It’s about the people – connecting with clients, partners, agencies, publishers and making new industry contacts. For me, it was also about meeting my amazing colleagues from Microsoft Advertising in person at the Microsoft booth. We sparked conversations in Cologne that will continue to flourish in the coming weeks.

📅 If you haven’t experienced DMEXCO yet and you’re eager to connect your brand and yourself in the Martech industry, get inspired on how to boost your business, and find the right partners to make it happen, start planning your participation for 2025!

👋 If you missed it and still want to learn more about Microsoft Advertising, please reach us... no need to wait for the next DMEXCO 😉

The event kicked off perfectly with the Dutch industry drinks hosted by VIA Nederland the evening before, setting the stage for a fantastic DMEXCO experience.

1. Preparation is key, so start weeks in advance ⏰
Set your own goals and start scheduling meetings according to these goals
 
2. Join your international stand or partner with your German colleagues, as we did at Adform. Thank you for the great organisation, Adform marketing ❤️
 
3. Don’t want to go alone? Join a partner or a larger group! Reach out to organizations like VIA Nederland for my follow Dutchies. 🇳🇱

5. Don’t miss the OM Club for some disco dancing. It’s part of the DMEXCO experience. 🕺

7234877470129164288,"🚀 DMEXCO 2024: Wir sind dabei! 🚀

Nachdem wir in diesem Jahr schon zum zweiten Mal auf der #OMR vertreten waren, sind wir vom 18. bis 19. September 2024 zum ersten Mal mit einem eigenen Stand auf der #DMEXCO in Köln am Start.

Ich muss zugeben, dass die DMEXCO in den letzten Jahren in meiner Wahrnehmung häufig hinter dem Tamtam der OMR zurück geblieben ist. Dabei passt die DMEXCO eigentlich viel besser zu inboundfriends und unseren Kunden.

Das hat vor allem drei Gründe:

💯 B2B statt B2C: Bei inboundfriends sind wir zu 100% auf B2B-Unternehmen spezialisiert. Damit passen wir super auf die DMEXCO, die einen stärkeren B2B-Fokus hat als die B2C-orientierte OMR.

🛠️ Tool-Expertise: Als Experten für CRM- und Marketing-Tools finden wir auf der DMEXCO wahrscheinlich mehr interessante Kontakte und potenzielle Kunden als auf der OMR. Viele namhafte Tool-Anbieter, wie @HubSpot, sind auf der DMEXCO sogar mit einem eigenen Stand vertreten.

🎉 Weniger Party, mehr Substanz: Wir konzentrieren uns als Agentur auf erklärungsbedürftige Produkte und Services. Ich hoffe, dass die DMEXCO mehr Raum für tiefgehende Gespräche zu komplexen Lösungen bietet als die OMR mit ihrem Party-Spektakel. Auch wenn ich meine Erinnerungen an unsere legendäre Standparty nicht missen möchte 😉 

Seid ihr eher Team DMEXCO oder Team OMR? Wer von euch ist am 18. und 19. September in Köln dabei?

Wenn ihr mehr über Marketing Automation und Lead Generierung mit HubSpot erfahren wollt, dann besucht uns an unserem Stand A021 in der Halle 08.1 oder bucht euch direkt einen Kennenlerntermin mit uns:

As an operator, install one simple script and monetise traffic from countries you are not allowed to convert, basically monetise remnant inventory easily.

A great example would be a brand like Betano who was a headline sponsor of Euro2024 but only accepts players from a short list of countries, a solution like FTDx would have helped improve the ROI on what I'm sure was a very expensive campaign.

Here are some key highlights from the panel:

🌟 Optimism around AI is strong—it's here to stay. We must embrace it and continue to educate ourselves further

👤 Adopt intelligent AI solutions that act as human as possible, bridging the necessary gap. Mantis suite of solutions analyses data with human-like precision, understanding tone, sentiment, and the true context of each page

💡 Senior leaders should adopt AI more actively, as over-reliance at entry levels can lead to an ill-educated workforce

🚀 AI is for everyone, it’s essential to leverage it to boost productivity and remove mundane tasks, but the human touch remains crucial

Attending DMEXCO, even for just one day, filled with a wealth of people, stages, and insightful content. Here are my personal takeaways:

1. Retailers are Becoming Creative Powerhouses 🎨:
Retailers are increasingly adopting creative approaches in advertising. For exmaple the Amazon Brand Lab Innovation Team is offering customized landing pages and innovative campaign concepts creating new online beauty destinations for our consumers.

2. AI: Beyond the Buzzword 🤖:
""AI"" was everywhere, but scalable use cases remain elusive. Kapten & Son's refreshing pragmatism resonated deeply: ""Focus on your basics, check your P&L, and work on topics like retention. Don't neglect the trends, but decide how much you're willing to invest."" A much-needed dose of reality!

3. Navigating the Retail Media Maze 🧭: 
IAB Europe statistics painted a stark picture: 113 active Retail Media networks in EMEA (plus retail-like media networks) highlight the fragmentation. Key takeaways?

Embrace Existing Standards: No need to reinvent the wheel.
Diversify Revenue Streams: Think beyond placements – consulting, data, and insights 
Forge Strategic Partnerships: Team up with powerhouses like The Trade Desk, Criteo, and even connected TV platforms.

Masterclass Insights: Nadine Kamski & Franziska Eickhoff, along with Amazon's Ad Tech Lead DE Cyrus Zaboli, delivered an insightful masterclass on ""Insights to Impact."" They showcased how Amazon & L'Oréal go beyond advertising. 

Connected Departments = Powerful Insights: Ecommerce, media, and data teams working together unlock a whole new level of understanding.

Amazon Marketing Cloud = Actionable Results: Activating insights through targeted audiences delivers serious impact, especially for always-on campaigns.

#ViralBeauty = Scalable Success: We saw firsthand how Amazon's markteting cloud audiences can be leveraged even in the upper funnel, making advertising more measurable and effective

#AI everywhere. That’s my summary of yesterday’s #CMO-Forum, where 60 fellow CMOs and I explored the future of #marketing, with AI taking center stage – from research to execution. It's crystal clear: AI is the ultimate game-changer for efficiency, #automation, speed, and personalized impact. Just think about translation and localization – tailoring campaigns for eeeeevery market with almost zero effort. 🤯 📈 

And here’s the fun part: we did a little experiment – AI-generated images vs. real-shot images – and 99% of us CMOs could still tell the difference!!! Controversial, right? Is AI ""good enough""? I think it is. The fast-paced digital world demands speed over perfection... and let’s be real... consumers’ attention spans are shorter than ever. 😉 
 
That was already a highlight... but the truuuue standout moment came in the evening: the #CMOoftheYear award gala. Key takeaways? Florian Haller nailed it in his dinner keynote: the modern CMO must master brand, demand, #tech, and most importantly: data, data, data! 🎶 Maybe that’s why I love what I do so much...

Biiiig shoutout to Daniel Grieder, CEO & CMO of BOSS, who took home the prestigious CMO of the Year award 🏆, recognizing the remarkable #transformation and turnaround of BOSS, with 2023 being its strongest year yet. The biggest risk? Taking no risk. (Kafka would agree. 😉) CONGRATS!! And soooo well deserved! 

Also, a huge congrats to Stefan Hoechter of Adelholzer for the CMO Lifetime Achievement Award. His mantra? It's all about people, trust, and creating safe spaces. Amen to that! When you lead with care, performance follows. Sounds familiar, right? 😛

#AI everywhere. That’s my summary of yesterday’s #CMO-Forum, where 60 fellow CMOs and I explored the future of #marketing, with AI taking center stage – from research to execution. It's crystal clear: AI is the ultimate game-changer for efficiency, #automation, speed, and personalized impact. Just think about translation and localization – tailoring campaigns for eeeeevery market with almost zero effort. 🤯 📈 

And here’s the fun part: we did a little experiment – AI-generated images vs. real-shot images – and 99% of us CMOs could still tell the difference!!! Controversial, right? Is AI ""good enough""? I think it is. The fast-paced digital world demands speed over perfection... and let’s be real... consumers’ attention spans are shorter than ever. 😉 
 
That was already a highlight... but the truuuue standout moment came in the evening: the #CMOoftheYear award gala. Key takeaways? Florian Haller nailed it in his dinner keynote: the modern CMO must master brand, demand, #tech, and most importantly: data, data, data! 🎶 Maybe that’s why I love what I do so much...

Biiiig shoutout to Daniel Grieder, CEO & CMO of BOSS, who took home the prestigious CMO of the Year award 🏆, recognizing the remarkable #transformation and turnaround of BOSS, with 2023 being its strongest year yet. The biggest risk? Taking no risk. (Kafka would agree. 😉) CONGRATS!! And soooo well deserved! 

Also, a huge congrats to Stefan Hoechter of Adelholzer for the CMO Lifetime Achievement Award. His mantra? It's all about people, trust, and creating safe spaces. Amen to that! When you lead with care, performance follows. Sounds familiar, right? 😛

The trend is moving towards campaigns with 𝐟𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬. While most brands were still working with 11 to 20 creators per campaign in 2021, the majority of brands reduced the number of creators to up to five in 2023. However, the number of campaigns is increasing, and the focus is on long-term relationships. 

At the same time, the number of creators has never been as large. In the USA, there are an 𝟐𝟕 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚, according to a study by The Keller Advisory Group. That's 14% of consumers between the ages of 16 and 54.

7242158622997196800,"I have a few thoughts about all the #DMEXCO updates Google announced (some good, some not so good). 

First, be sure to read the great recap from Ginny Marvin here: https://lnkd.in/ev93Fn2R

The Objectively Good:
😄 More PMax data is always a good thing and I'm really excited about target pacing and asset insights! Also the campaign level negatives (without the need for a form)! We are getting impression share metrics (fist spotted by Odi Caspi) but I have mixed feelings about those. 

😄 Pinning for demand gen videos is a godsend! No longer are we rolling the dice on Google understanding the best placement/length for our content. 

😄 AI visual enhancement for all campaign types is a huge boon ahead of Q4! I'm extremely excited to see how the seed images and text descriptions help improve the AI for PMax and Search campaigns alike.  

The Optimist's Excitement:
😍 I'm very interested in the asset recommendations and I'm wondering if this is a sign that the LLMs are getting more intelligent around how different creative resonates with different personas.

😍 I'm fully team brand guidelines and while I know others are cynical about them, I truly believe they will help.

😍 Multi-lingual asset generation can be really good or really bad. I'm leaning into hope here. 

The Cynic's Reservations:
🤔 PMax getting impression share is more concerning to me than anything else. Impression share can only be for search and shopping, and getting that data does two potentially harmful things. It reenforces search bias when the point of PMax is to remove the bias from budget allocation. It also sets us up to hear about a problem that can only be solved by more budget. One of the reasons I love using impression share is to find structural areas to improve campaigns - that's not really possible with PMax...you just add more budget or limit what you're going after. 

🤔 I'm not crazy about 360 getting more tools. More often than not, 360 is more trouble than it's worth, and while enterprise brands can have valid uses for it, there are a lot of folks who struggle to recover from the migration. I'd have liked to see tools for the little guys as opposed to more 360 enhancements.

🤔 Google outright said PMax wouldn't get impression share last year. Now it's rolling out for search and shopping. I can't help but wonder if this is one of the foundational steps to make search/shopping exclusively available through PMax (which isn't inherently a bad thing but not everyone is prepared for that campaign type). This feels especially true since Google's search text advertising business would be a monopoly (if the US could define it as a market), while search advertising was not a monopoly.

7209532960100773889,"Part 2:

Last week I shared the first 5 of Greg Topalian’s 10 year/10 predictions for our industry. 

Greg shared these during his session at The Exhibitions and Conventions Executive Forum in DC.

Here’s the final 5:

6️⃣ 40/60% of trade show revenues will come from attendees.
- There are/will be new ways to charge and increase revenues if you focus on the attendees and the experiences they want and will pay for. 
- Balance revenues out and stop the overreliance on sponsorships.

7️⃣ Attendees want meetings but are telling us “I don’t want to meet the people you want me to meet with. I want to choose, not you”. 
- Ask attendees who they want to meet.
- Then make sure they meet.

8️⃣ It’s far too easy to keep charging exhibitors a bit more than to try and solve the BIG problems (like unlocking the meetings issue). 
- Squeezing revenues from exhibitors has gotten old and limiting so stop focusing on that.
- Sort out your big issues which would fix revenues for the long term.

9️⃣ Your industry isn't that special. Lots of event execs say, “My industry wouldn’t like that,” but even accountants have human interests, like sports, music, etc. 
- Remember your industry is made up of real people, not job titles. 
- No matter what someone does for a job - don’t stereotype the kind of experience they might like because of their (supposedly boring) job title. 

🔟 Organisers will ask themselves, “Can I really create the experience I want in a traditional exhibition venue?” The answer may well be “no.” 
- We’ll see more events running in unusual venues, which allow them to deliver richer experiences.

Anything to add?

We listened to customers on both sides: those rated by EcoVadis and those requesting ESG evaluations of their trading partners. It was an energizing event, one that allowed us to exchange ideas, bows and above all, discuss how we can collectively work together to accelerate impact. A big thank you to everyone involved ! どうもありがとう

It was a refreshing in person exchange on best practices, based on our customers' experiences, including opportunities for better supplier engagement, improving trading partner's scores and even a panel with suppliers highlighting their expectations and challenges. We also unveiled new EcoVadis functionalities and features that allow companies to further deployment of their strategies.

It was a special event one that was excellently managed from conception to completion by our very own Mahoko Yoshimoto. An important milestone as it was our first in person World Tour event in the Asia Pacific Japan region. Plenty of interesting discussions during the event and at our special networking event after the show. I am looking forward to doing more with our partners and customers. 

Thank you Tokyo for always being so welcoming and sparking many conversations and new ideas.

Interested in doing more with EcoVadis? Please message me if so and I will put you in touch with the right person.

Historical industry statistics don't lie: between 2000 and 2014 alone, clothing production doubled, and consumers began buying 60 percent more clothes and wearing them for half as long as before. In the world today, more than 100 billion pieces of clothing are produced per year for a global population of 8 billion people.

Is there a solution to this reality? 

Appeal to a change in habits, but also the use of new inputs and fabrics of forest origin that consume a third of the energy and 60 times less water when compared to a synthetic fiber or cotton.

This was one of the topics addressed at the Milan conference “Challenge the Fabric 2024”, which focused on sustainability, traceability and innovation in materials in the fashion industry and challenged designers to create sustainable looks to promote a shift towards bio-based and recycled materials.

We had the opportunity to share Arauco’s sustainability practices in this challenging times and some trends that we see are going to happen in the future. New regulations, Ecosystem Services at Landscapes, and Nature Positiveness where some of them.

Historical industry statistics don't lie: between 2000 and 2014 alone, clothing production doubled, and consumers began buying 60 percent more clothes and wearing them for half as long as before. In the world today, more than 100 billion pieces of clothing are produced per year for a global population of 8 billion people.

Is there a solution to this reality? 

Appeal to a change in habits, but also the use of new inputs and fabrics of forest origin that consume a third of the energy and 60 times less water when compared to a synthetic fiber or cotton.

This was one of the topics addressed at the Milan conference “Challenge the Fabric 2024”, which focused on sustainability, traceability and innovation in materials in the fashion industry and challenged designers to create sustainable looks to promote a shift towards bio-based and recycled materials.

We had the opportunity to share Arauco’s sustainability practices in this challenging times and some trends that we see are going to happen in the future. New regulations, Ecosystem Services at Landscapes, and Nature Positiveness where some of them. 

Thank you Ekman Group and Nina Elmersson & Malin Hagström for the invitation and the other panelists with whom I had the chance to participate here in Italy.

7214532127462236160,"From Beijing onto Qingdao – the NTRO - National Transport Research Organisation GTC adventure continues by bullet train! 🚅 The transport geek in me was overjoyed.

The World Transport Convention was our next stop with CEO Michael Caltabiano delivering a high-energy keynote speech to open the event. 

As part of the China-Australia technical exchange, the conference provided me the opportunity to present how road safety initiatives not only save lives but also drive economic and community benefits, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals to reduce global road deaths and injuries by half. I shared statistics around lives lost on Australian roads – and how this varies dramatically depending on where you live, NetRisk2 and Network Safety Plans using AusRAP Star Ratings. 

The exhibition hall was a dazzling display of lights, tech and innovations. 

Networking and site visit opportunities included:
🚙 JSTI to learn about how they are managing assets for maintenance and safety and optimising networks
🚢  Shandong Port Group where we met with leaders and key staff for a tour of this world-leading automated container port
🚦 Hisense Group Smart City  for a tour of their showroom filled with new and upcoming urban mobility technology. 

Finished the trip with a visit to the Tsingtao brewery and bringing a few samples home for my husband. 🍺

7250232546943188992,"[Video Recap of SparkTogether 2024] SparkTogether by SparkToro and Amanda Natividad is the best conference I’ve ever been to. Having won best speaker at the remote event last year and being invited to speak again this year, I intended to spit fire like a fully grown dragon and win the title again. 

However, I was quickly humbled when the other speakers ignited the stage.

They didn’t spit fire, they were fire. One by one like Phoenixes they bared their souls setting the room ablaze with wisdom and incredibly powerful stories.

We SparkedTogether!

Sarah Stockdale who inspired my talk and helped improve it got the only standing ovation. Her talk was nuclear and left the room with a radiant glow of inspiration. The ovation is in the video so watch it.

-SparkTogether is not an SEO conference but I learned some things about SEO
-It’s not a business conference but I learned a lot about business
-It’s not a Tony Robbin’s life coaching event, but I learned a lot about life, finding my purpose and got inspired.

-I learned that lots of agencies & business owners have suffered in the last few years and what they did to survive 
-I learned about the power of being vulnerable and asking for help. 
-I learned how to go viral and why it’s important that, that should not be your goal. 
-I learned how to publish a book and I got inspired by many of the attendees that I talked to who are incredible human beings.

SparkTogether is an experience.
We laughed, we cried, we learned.
We SparkedTogether.

As a speaker, finding a stage to be authentic and vulnerable is hard. It’s almost impossible at normal conferences. 

SparkTogether is different because it is built for that.

I shared the stage with the best of the best:

 Rand Fishkin, Geraldine DeRuiter, Ann Handley, Sarah Stockdale, Eli Goodman, Britney Muller, Michael King, and Anne-Laure Le Cunff.

When I left it exhausted and depleted because I relived life and death traumas, trying to show people how and why they should use their digital marketing skills for good. Geraldine stole my speaker badge and flashed me a cheeky smiley saying, “Looking for this?!” It’s the laugh I needed and made me realize why meeting people in real life at events like this is important. 😂 

Geraldine’s talk was incredible! If you go to any conference next year it has to be this one. Hopefully I’ll see you there and we can SparkTogether.

Thank you Rand, Amanda Natividad, Casey Henry and everyone I meet in person, for an incredible experience. 

Shout out to Kateri Kosta and her friend for sharing this amazing experience with me.

A heartfelt thank you to Ofer and Amit for affording me the opportunity to particpate and be a part of the company.  It has been a pleasure to serve and contribute to the Advisory Board.  Best to all and may the days ahead be even brighter.
","In what has been a sad, dark and challenging time for Israel the past few weeks, I have some good news, a spark of bright light, to share. Today, Palo Alto Networks announced its intent to acquire Talon Cyber Security! 
 
This is a strategic move that, once closed, will align incredible teams and technologies to execute on the vision of securing ALL users, from EVERY device, that access corporate applications and data. 
 
When we started Talon, we had a bold goal: to power and protect as many leading organizations and as many users as possible. By combining Talon’s Enterprise Browser technology with Prisma® SASE after closing, we will only accelerate our vision and provide more value to our customers. 
 
This milestone represents a new chapter in Talon’s journey – a chapter that will consist of unmatched innovation, value added, strong Go-To-Market, and its fair share of additional milestones. 
 
As an entrepreneur, I could not be more excited to see something the team and I helped shape and build, become a part of the strategy of one of the world’s true cybersecurity leaders. 
 
This also serves as a clear testament to the strength and resilience of the Israeli tech community. We continue to deliver, continue to push boundaries, and continue to have success, #nomatterwhat. 
 
To my co-founder, Ohad Bobrov, thank you so much for your dedication and partnership. I wouldn’t want to be on this journey with anyone else.  
 
To my amazing wife, Dana El-On, thank you for your unwavering love, support, and for pushing me to be a better leader and entrepreneur, every day. 
 
Last, and absolutely not least, a huge thank you to our team members, customers, partners, and investors for your support and impact. We look forward to continuing to work closely with you all to tackle challenges and make the world a safer, more secure place. 
 
Back to work :)

I wanted to share some exciting news—I’m heading to Cologne for DMEXCO on September 18th and 19th with the Clearcode team. You can find me at our booth in Hall 6.1, T025.

I'd love to meet AdTech leaders as you play a key role in shaping successful collaborations.

Let's get together and talk about how we, as an AdTech software development company, can support your initiatives with our technical expertise and domain knowledge.

We’re also hosting a Masterclass, “The AdTech Dilemma: Build vs Rent vs Buy,” on September 19th at 10:00 AM in MC 7B. 

This session will delve into the crucial factors for deciding whether to build, rent, or buy an AdTech platform. We’ll examine the benefits and drawbacks of each option and provide real-world examples from companies navigating these choices in their AdTech strategies.

How about we explore ways to partner up and create some incredible opportunities together? 💡 You can book a slot with me here:
