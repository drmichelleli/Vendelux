# Vendelux

The Vendelux project is to determine whether LinkedIn posts indicate attendance at an event. The task is to classify posts that may or may not be related to an event named DMEXCO 2024. The dataset is of ~1,600 labeled observations. Each observation contains a LinkedIn post and a
label:
● “Yes”: The post suggests the user is attending the 2024 event (even loosely, such as
planning to attend, promoting, or expressing general interest).
● “No”: The post does not suggest the user is attending the 2024 event.
